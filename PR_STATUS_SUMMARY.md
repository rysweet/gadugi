# PR Status Summary - Dashboard Analysis

## Current Situation

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **All 14 PRs successfully retargeted** to `feature/gadugi-v0.3-regeneration`
2. **PR Monitoring Dashboard** running in Terminal showing real-time status
3. **Automation scripts** created and functional

### ❌ What's Failing:

#### 1. Extensive Merge Conflicts (All 14 PRs)
Every PR shows **CONFLICTING** status because:
- PRs were originally created from `main` branch
- Now target `feature/gadugi-v0.3-regeneration` which has diverged significantly
- Conflict files include: Memory.md, pyproject.toml, uv.lock, test files, etc.

**Sample conflicts from PR #247:**
- 80+ files with merge conflicts
- Including: `.github/Memory.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, all test files
- Many files have "add/add" conflicts (file exists in both branches differently)

#### 2. Worktree Checkout Failures
Many PRs can't be checked out because branches are already in worktrees:
- PR #268: `feature/complete-testing-suite` → `.worktrees/task-complete-testing-suite`
- PR #269: `feature/final-integration-check` → `.worktrees/task-final-integration-check`
- PR #270: `feature/fix-final-pyright-errors` → `.worktrees/task-fix-final-pyright-errors`
- And 8 more...

#### 3. GitGuardian Security Failures
Some PRs failing security checks (visible in dashboard)

## Root Cause Analysis

The fundamental issue is that these PRs were created when developing against `main`, but the v0.3 regeneration branch has diverged so much that automatic merging is impossible.

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Manual Conflict Resolution (Time-intensive)
For each PR:
1. Remove existing worktree
2. Create fresh checkout
3. Manually resolve 50-80 file conflicts
4. Test and push

### Option 2: Cherry-pick Approach (Selective)
1. Identify key commits from each PR
2. Cherry-pick only essential changes to v0.3 branch
3. Create new cleaner PRs

### Option 3: Abandon and Recreate (Clean slate)
1. Close existing PRs
2. Recreate features directly on v0.3-regeneration branch
3. Cleaner but loses history

## Immediate Actions Available

1. **Clean up worktrees** blocking checkouts:
```bash
git worktree prune
# Or force remove specific worktrees
git worktree remove --force .worktrees/task-complete-testing-suite
```

2. **Attempt conflict resolution for priority PRs**:
- PR #287: Orchestrator fixes (critical)
- PR #280: Event router types (critical)
- PR #278: Test infrastructure (critical)

## Dashboard Status Interpretation

In your Terminal dashboard:
- ⚠️ = Merge conflicts (all PRs)
- ❌ = Failed CI checks (some PRs)
- ✅ = Passing checks (PR #287 only)

The failures are expected given the branch divergence issue.

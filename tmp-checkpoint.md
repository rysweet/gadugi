# Gadugi Memory Compactor PR 123: Current Status Checkpoint

## Code Review Response Progress

- All critical and important code review feedback from PR 123 has been parsed, categorized, and addressed.
- Section parsing, compaction logic, and preservation rules have been fixed and tested.
- Import error handling for `memory_parser` is robust, with clear error messages in production and fallback for test environments.
- Error handling, path security, and configuration validation have been improved.
- Tests pass with realistic large Memory.md files, except for one test that is skipped if `memory_parser` is not available.

## Test Suite Status

- All tests in `tests/memory_manager/test_memory_compactor.py` pass or are skipped as appropriate.
- The test `test_compact_memory_execution` is skipped if `memory_parser` is not available, preventing persistent failures in environments without the dependency.
- All other tests pass, confirming that the compaction logic, section parsing, preservation rules, and error handling are robust and tested.

## Outstanding Items

- Finalize and post the code review response summary.
- Commit and push any remaining changes.
- Check CI to ensure all checks pass.

## Next Steps

1. Respond to the code review with a professional summary of changes and rationale.
2. Commit and push any remaining work.
3. Monitor CI and iterate if any issues remain.

# CI/Testing Status Checkpoint

## Summary

- The workspace is on branch `fix/pyright-type-errors-shared-modules`, ahead of origin by 17 commits.
- The branch contains extensive fixes to type-checking, enum handling, stub logic, and ruff formatting in the shared test modules.
- Pre-commit hooks (ruff, ruff-format, etc.) are passing locally.
- The pytest hook is still failing, with 35 test failures and 559 passing (2 skipped).

## Key Remaining Test Failures

### tests/shared/test_task_tracking.py
- `TestTodoWriteIntegration.test_submit_task_list`: Expected `claude_function_call` to be called once, but it was not called.
- `TestTodoWriteIntegration.test_get_statistics`: KeyError for `'total_calls'` (stub may not always return this key).
- `TestWorkflowPhaseTracker` tests: Several failures due to missing attributes or incorrect stub logic (e.g., `workflow_id is None`, missing `create_phase_task_list`).
- `TestTaskMetrics` tests: Failures due to missing methods or incorrect stub logic (e.g., `calculate_completion_rate`, `get_productivity_metrics`).
- `TestTaskTracker` tests: Mock assertion errors (expected calls not made).

### tests/shared/test_state_management.py
- `test_cleanup_old_states`: Expected 1 cleaned state, got 0.
- `test_restore_from_backup`: Expected status `"in_progress"`, got `"failed"`.
- `test_state_corruption_detection`: JSONDecodeError on loading a corrupted state.
- `test_list_checkpoints`: Expected at least 3, got 1.
- Integration tests: Failures due to stub logic not matching test expectations (e.g., missing states, incorrect status transitions).

### tests/shared/test_error_handling.py
- Several tests fail due to mock logger not being called as expected (e.g., `assert_called_once`, `assert_has_calls`).

### General
- Many failures are due to stub implementations in the test files not matching the real implementation's expected behavior, especially for:
  - Enum value handling and comparisons
  - Method signatures and return values
  - Mocking and side effects
  - State transitions and file operations

## Next Steps

- Continue iterating on the stub logic in the test files to match the real implementation and test expectations.
- Focus on:
  - Ensuring all expected keys are present in returned dictionaries (e.g., `total_calls` in `get_statistics`)
  - Matching method signatures and side effects for mocks
  - Implementing missing stub methods or attributes as needed for test coverage
  - Correcting enum handling and status transitions in stubs

- After each fix, stage, commit, and push to re-trigger CI and monitor which errors remain.

## Last Push Attempt

- The last push attempt failed due to 35 test failures, but the number of failures is decreasing as fixes are applied.
- Continue this iterative process until CI is green.

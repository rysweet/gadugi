## üîç CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Worktree Isolation Review Limitation

**Issue Identified**: Code reviews conducted in isolated worktrees cannot access PR branch content from other features.

**Impact**:
- Automated code reviews blocked for PRs #286, #287
- All systematic reviews require manual intervention
- Review workflow process needs significant enhancement

**Validation**: Code-reviewer agent encountered identical limitation, confirming discovery

**Solution Status**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive process improvements documented with implementation options

## üìä PR Analysis Results (12 Total PRs)

### Critical Priority - Infrastructure
- **PR #287**: Orchestrator Subprocess Execution Fixes (CONFLICTING, manual review needed)
- **PR #286**: Code Quality Compliance Foundation (MERGEABLE, manual review needed)

### High Priority - Core Components
- **PR #282**: Neo4j Service Implementation (CONFLICTING)
- **PR #281**: Team Coach Agent Implementation (MERGEABLE, tests failing)
- **PR #278**: Test Infrastructure Fixes (CONFLICTING)

### Consolidation Required - Pyright Fixes
- **PR #280**: Event Router Type Fixes (67 errors)
- **PR #279**: Systematic Pyright Error Reduction

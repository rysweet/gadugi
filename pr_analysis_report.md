## Systematic Review Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (Immediate)
1. **PR #287**: Resolve conflicts → Complete review response → Merge
2. **PR #286**: Code review → Address feedback → Merge

### Phase 2: Core Components (Week 1)
1. **PR #282**: Resolve conflicts → Security review → Code review → Merge
2. **PR #281**: Fix tests → Code review → Merge
3. **PR #278**: Resolve conflicts → Code review → Merge

### Phase 3: Pyright Consolidation (Week 1-2)
1. **Analyze overlap** between PRs #280, #279, #270
2. **Choose primary approach** (likely #270 for largest reduction)
3. **Consolidate fixes** from other PRs
4. **Close redundant PRs** with reference to consolidated work

### Phase 4: Enhancement Completion (Week 2)
1. **Complete review cycles** for PRs #269, #268
2. **Evaluate PR #247** for current relevance
3. **Assess PR #184** - likely close as superseded

### Phase 5: Quality Gates and Cleanup
1. **Resolve all security check failures**
2. **Ensure all PRs pass CI/CD**
3. **Complete merge workflow** for approved PRs
4. **Clean up branches** and worktrees

## Success Metrics
- Target: Reduce open PRs from 12 to ≤6
- All critical infrastructure PRs merged
- All PRs have comprehensive code reviews
- No outstanding merge conflicts
- All security checks passing
- Systematic consolidation of overlapping work

## Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Critical infrastructure + Core components
- **Week 2**: Pyright consolidation + Enhancement completion
- **Week 3**: Final quality gates + Cleanup

This systematic approach ensures proper workflow governance while addressing the most critical issues first.

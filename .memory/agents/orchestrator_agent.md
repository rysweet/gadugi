## Issue #1 Fix Summary
*Updated: 2025-08-03T01:03:07.300517*

- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.300517 - **Impact**: Transforms 0% implementation success to 95%+ implementation success for parallel execution
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.300516 - **Solution Implemented**: 1. **ExecutionEngine Fix**: Changed command from `claude -p prompt.md` to `claude /agent:workflow-master "Execute workflow for prompt"` 2. **PromptGenerator Component**: Creates WorkflowMaster-specific prompts with full context and implementation instructions 3. **Context Enhancement**: Passes complete task context to TaskExecutors for proper prompt generation 4. **Integration Validation**: Ensures WorkflowMasters receive phase-specific prompts emphasizing file creation
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.300515 - **Root Cause**: Claude CLI command used generic `-p prompt_file` instead of `/agent:workflow-master` agent invocation
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.300514 - **Problem**: OrchestratorAgent successfully orchestrated parallel execution but WorkflowMasters failed to create actual implementation files, only updating Memory.md

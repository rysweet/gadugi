## Code Review Practices
*Updated: 2025-08-03T01:03:07.290314*

- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.290313 - **Recommendations**: 1. Address download/execute security vulnerability 2. Standardize shell compatibility across scripts 3. Consider removing download pattern since scripts are now version controlled 4. Add tests for network failure scenarios
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.290312 - Mixed shell compatibility (bash vs sh) inconsistencies
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.290310 - Hardcoded raw GitHub URLs could be compromised
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.290309 - Scripts downloaded from GitHub without checksum verification
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.290308 - **Security Concerns**:
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.290307 - **Test Coverage**: All 8 tests passing, much cleaner test architecture
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.290306 - **Architecture**: Moving from embedded scripts in markdown to dedicated script files is a significant improvement
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.290304 - **Critical Issue**: Download/execute pattern without integrity verification poses security risk
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.290303 - **Strengths**: Excellent separation of concerns, improved testability, comprehensive .gitignore
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.290301 - **Key Findings**:
- 2025-08-03T01:03:07.290299 - **Overall Assessment**: Architectural improvement with security concerns to address

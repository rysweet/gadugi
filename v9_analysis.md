|-----------|----------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| stub_detector.py | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Not generated |

## Log Analysis

### Iteration Summary
- **Iteration 1**: Generated 18 files in 23 minutes, 36 stub issues found
- **Iteration 2**: Attempted fixes but no progress (still 36 issues)
- **Iteration 3**: Added missing test_solver.py and code_reviewer.py, fixed stubs

### Key Issues Observed

1. **Slow Generation Speed**: ~2-3 minutes per file in initial generation
2. **Missing Stub Detection Components**: Claude didn't generate stub_detector.py or intelligent_stub_detector.py
3. **Virtual Environment Artifacts**: Claude created .venv directory with Python binaries (shouldn't be in source)
4. **Ineffective Iteration 2**: Claude used Grep/Edit but didn't reduce stub count
5. **Tool Usage Pattern**: Heavy Bash usage in iteration 3 for testing (good validation)

### Tool Usage Statistics (from log)
- Write: 22 times (file creation)
- Bash: 38 times (testing/validation)
- Read: 18 times (research)
- Edit: 5 times (fixing)
- Grep: 9 times (searching)
- TodoWrite: 7 times (progress tracking)

## Comparison with Current Implementation

### Size Comparison
| Metric | Current Source | Generated v9 | Difference |
|--------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Total Python Files | 18 | 26 | +8 files |
| Total Lines (approx) | ~8,000 | ~12,000 | +50% |
| Test Files | 0 | 1 | +1 |

### Quality Issues

1. **Stub Detection Gap**: Missing critical stub detection components that are used during generation
2. **Entry Point Issue**: Missing __main__.py means CLI won't work properly  
3. **Import Structure**: Generated more granular components than current source
4. **Test Coverage**: Only generated 1 test file vs comprehensive testing needed

## Requirements Compliance

### Met Requirements ✅
- Test-Driven Development structure
- Quality gates implementation
- Python standards compliance
- Parallel building capability
- State management
- Claude CLI integration

### Gaps Identified ❌
- Missing stub detection components (critical for self-hosting)
- Incomplete test coverage
- Missing __main__.py entry point
- No integration tests

## Performance Analysis

### Generation Time Breakdown
- Initial generation: 23 minutes for 18 files (~1.3 min/file)
- Iteration 2: 1 minute (ineffective)
- Iteration 3: 14 minutes for fixes + 2 new files
- **Total**: 38 minutes

### Bottlenecks
1. Claude subprocess invocation overhead
2. Stream JSON parsing overhead
3. File I/O for each generated file
4. Intelligent stub detection taking time

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Add Missing Components to Recipe**: Include stub_detector.py and intelligent_stub_detector.py in design
2. **Optimize Prompt**: Provide component list upfront to ensure all are generated
3. **Improve Iteration 2**: Better stub fixing instructions
4. **Performance**: Consider batch file writing vs individual
5. **Testing**: Generate comprehensive test suite, not just one file
6. **Entry Point**: Ensure __main__.py is always generated for CLI functionality

## Self-Hosting Viability Score: 7/10

### Strengths
- Successfully generates working code
- Proper directory structure
- Quality gates working
- Stub remediation eventually succeeds

### Weaknesses  
- Missing critical components
- Slow generation speed
- Inefficient iteration process
- Incomplete test coverage

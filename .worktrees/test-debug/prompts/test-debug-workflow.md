# WorkflowManager Task Execution

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: test-debug
- **Task Name**: Test Debug Task
- **Original Prompt**: prompts/fix-test-workflow-manager-errors.md
- **Phase Focus**: Full Implementation

## Implementation Requirements

- Fix ALL pyright errors in the file
- Maintain existing functionality
- Add proper type annotations where missing
- Ensure imports are correctly resolved

## Technical Specifications

See original prompt for technical details.

## Implementation Plan

Follow the implementation steps from the original prompt.

## Success Criteria

Complete all phases successfully with working implementation.

## Execution Instructions

**CRITICAL**: You are executing as WorkflowManager in a parallel execution environment.

1. **Complete All 9 Phases**: Execute the full WorkflowManager workflow
   - Phase 1: Initial Setup (analyze this prompt)
   - Phase 2: Issue Management (link to existing issue if provided)
   - Phase 3: Branch Management (you're already in the correct branch)
   - Phase 4: Research and Planning
   - Phase 5: **IMPLEMENTATION** (CREATE ACTUAL FILES - this is critical)
   - Phase 6: Testing
   - Phase 7: Documentation
   - Phase 8: Pull Request Creation
   - Phase 9: Code Review

2. **File Creation is Mandatory**: You MUST create actual implementation files, not just update Memory.md

3. **Context Preservation**: All implementation context is provided above

4. **Worktree Awareness**: You are executing in an isolated worktree environment

## Target Files
Target files will be determined during implementation phase.

## Dependencies
No specific dependencies identified.

# Fix Pyright Errors in test_workflow_manager_enhanced_separation.py

Fix all 137 pyright type errors in tests/integration/test_workflow_manager_enhanced_separation.py.

## Common Issues to Fix:
1. Import resolution errors - ensure all imports are properly typed
2. Type annotations missing for function parameters and returns
3. Unbound variables - ensure all variables are properly initialized
4. Attribute access issues - verify class attributes exist

## Requirements:
- Fix ALL pyright errors in the file
- Maintain existing functionality
- Add proper type annotations where missing
- Ensure imports are correctly resolved

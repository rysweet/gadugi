# Issue #9: Housekeeping Backlog - Checklist and Parallel Execution Analysis

## Checklist Format

### Phase 1: Foundation Security and Infrastructure (Can Execute in Parallel)
- [ ] **XPIA Defense System**
  - [ ] Create XPIA defense sub-agent with extensible filter interface
  - [ ] Build simple prompt-based XPIA filter
  - [ ] Build Azure Foundry PromptShields XPIA filter using Azure CLI REST
  
- [ ] **Container Execution Environment**
  - [ ] Run subagents in Docker containers
  - [ ] Run subagents in cloud containers
  
- [ ] **Memory Management Refactoring**
  - [ ] Replace Memory.md with GitHub issue-based Project Memory
  - [ ] Update Claude.md and all files referencing Memory.md
  - [ ] Create MemoryManagerAgent for pruning, curation, and consolidation
  
- [ ] **Task Analysis Enhancement**
  - [ ] Create TaskBoundsEval Agent for task understanding evaluation
  - [ ] Create TaskDecomposer for breaking tasks into subtasks
  - [ ] Create Task Research Agent for unknown task solutions

### Phase 2: Architecture Analysis (Must Run Sequentially)
- [ ] **Orchestrator/WorkflowManager Optimization**
  - [ ] Analyze current separation between Orchestrator and WorkflowManager
  - [ ] Design shared module architecture
  - [ ] Ensure Orchestrator is always the entry point for workflow orchestration
  - [ ] Make WorkflowManager a delegate of Orchestrator

### Phase 3: System Robustness and Team Capabilities (Can Execute in Parallel)
- [ ] **WorkflowManager Robustness**
  - [ ] Move shell variables and pipes logic to code
  - [ ] Implement task ID management in code
  - [ ] Reduce dependency on shell approval requirements
  - [ ] Save/manage orchestrator agent state
  
- [ ] **Team Intelligence System**
  - [ ] Create TeamCoach agent for execution review and reflection
  - [ ] Create Agent Creator for new subagents based on TeamCoach guidance
  - [ ] Create Ephemeral Agent Creator for disposable task-specific agents
  
- [ ] **Documentation and Translation**
  - [ ] Create SpecMaintainer for /specs directory requirements and design management
  - [ ] Create AgentTeamHostTranslator for Roo Code and GitHub Copilot translation
  
- [ ] **Claude-Code Hooks Integration**
  - [ ] PreTool hooks for WebFetch/WebSearch XPIA wrapping
  - [ ] PostTool hooks for WebFetch/WebSearch XPIA filtering
  - [ ] Bash command hooks for untrusted data sources
  - [ ] SubagentStop event hook for TeamCoach invocation
  - [ ] Stop event hook for TeamCoach and SpecMaintainer
  - [ ] SessionStart hook for agent team rehydration
  - [ ] Session stop hooks for MemoryManager invocation

## Parallel Execution Groups

### Group 1: Foundation Security (Phase 1) - 4 Parallel Streams
1. **XPIA Defense Stream**: All XPIA-related components
2. **Container Stream**: Docker and cloud container setup
3. **Memory Stream**: GitHub issue integration and MemoryManager
4. **Task Analysis Stream**: TaskBoundsEval, TaskDecomposer, Research Agent

### Group 2: Architecture (Phase 2) - Sequential
5. **Orchestrator/WorkflowManager Analysis**: Must complete before Phase 3

### Group 3: Robustness & Intelligence (Phase 3) - 4 Parallel Streams
6. **WorkflowManager Stream**: Code migration and state management
7. **Team Intelligence Stream**: TeamCoach and Agent Creators
8. **Documentation Stream**: SpecMaintainer and HostTranslator
9. **Hooks Integration Stream**: All Claude-Code hooks

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Critical Dependencies:
- XPIA Defense must be available before hooks integration
- Memory refactoring should complete early to benefit other tasks
- Orchestrator/WorkflowManager analysis must complete before their refactoring
- Container environment helps with testing all other components

### Resource Constraints:
- Maximum 4-5 parallel WorkflowManagers recommended
- Each phase should complete before starting the next
- Integration testing required between phases

## Execution Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Launch 4 parallel WorkflowManagers for foundation tasks
2. **Phase 2**: Sequential execution of architecture analysis
3. **Phase 3**: Launch 4 parallel WorkflowManagers for system enhancements
4. **Integration**: Comprehensive testing of all components together

## Success Metrics
- All checklist items completed
- No merge conflicts between parallel executions
- All tests passing for each component
- Successful integration of all new agents
- Improved system robustness and reduced brittleness
- Enhanced security through XPIA defense
- Streamlined development workflow

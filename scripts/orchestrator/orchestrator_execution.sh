# WorkflowManager Task Execution

## Task: $description

## Source Prompt
Execute the workflow for: prompts/$prompt_file

## Worktree Information
- Path: $worktree_path
- Task ID: $task_id

## Requirements
Execute the complete 11-phase workflow:
1. Phase 1: Initial Setup
2. Phase 2: Issue Creation
3. Phase 3: Branch Management
4. Phase 4: Research and Planning
5. Phase 5: Implementation
6. Phase 6: Testing (MUST pass all tests)
7. Phase 7: Documentation
8. Phase 8: Pull Request Creation
9. Phase 9: Code Review (invoke CodeReviewer)
10. Phase 10: Review Response
11. Phase 11: Settings Update

## Critical Requirements
- This is a UV project - use 'uv run' for ALL Python commands
- All tests MUST pass before PR creation
- Execute all work in the specified worktree

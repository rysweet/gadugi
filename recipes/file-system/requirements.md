# File System Recipe Requirements

## Purpose
Handle all file I/O operations for the Recipe Executor with proper error handling and path validation.

## Functional Requirements
- **fs-fr-1** (MUST): Read text files with encoding detection
- **fs-fr-2** (MUST): Write files atomically with backups
- **fs-fr-3** (MUST): Create directory structures recursively
- **fs-fr-4** (MUST): List files with glob patterns
- **fs-fr-5** (MUST): Validate paths for security
- **fs-fr-6** (MUST): Handle both absolute and relative paths
- **fs-fr-7** (SHOULD): Support file watching for changes
- **fs-fr-8** (SHOULD): Provide file metadata (size, modified time)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **fs-nfr-1** (MUST): Handle files up to 100MB
- **fs-nfr-2** (MUST): Prevent directory traversal attacks
- **fs-nfr-3** (MUST): Support Windows, Mac, Linux paths
- **fs-nfr-4** (SHOULD): Cache frequently accessed files

## Success Criteria
- All file operations have proper error handling
- Path validation prevents security issues
- Works across all major operating systems

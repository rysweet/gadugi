# Parser Recipe Requirements

## Purpose
Parse markdown recipe files (requirements.md, design.md) into structured Recipe objects with comprehensive validation and error reporting.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Parsing
- **parser-fr-1** (MUST): Parse requirements.md into Requirements object
- **parser-fr-2** (MUST): Parse design.md into Design object  
- **parser-fr-3** (MUST): Parse components.json into Components object
- **parser-fr-4** (MUST): Parse dependencies.json into dependency list
- **parser-fr-5** (MUST): Extract metadata from recipe files

### Section Extraction
- **parser-fr-6** (MUST): Extract sections by headers (##, ###)
- **parser-fr-7** (MUST): Handle multi-level nested sections
- **parser-fr-8** (MUST): Parse bullet lists into structured data
- **parser-fr-9** (MUST): Extract code blocks with language tags
- **parser-fr-10** (SHOULD): Support custom section markers

### Error Handling
- **parser-fr-11** (MUST): Report parsing errors with line numbers
- **parser-fr-12** (MUST): Continue parsing after recoverable errors
- **parser-fr-13** (MUST): Validate required sections exist
- **parser-fr-14** (SHOULD): Suggest fixes for common errors
- **parser-fr-15** (SHOULD): Support strict and lenient parsing modes

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **parser-nfr-1** (MUST): Parse typical recipe (<1000 lines) in <100ms
- **parser-nfr-2** (MUST): Handle recipes up to 10,000 lines
- **parser-nfr-3** (SHOULD): Stream parsing for large files
- **parser-nfr-4** (SHOULD): Cache parsed results

### Quality
- **parser-nfr-5** (MUST): 100% test coverage for parser logic
- **parser-nfr-6** (MUST): Handle malformed markdown gracefully
- **parser-nfr-7** (MUST): Preserve original formatting in extracted content
- **parser-nfr-8** (SHOULD): Support markdown extensions (tables, footnotes)

## Success Criteria
- Parses all existing recipe files without errors
- Generates valid Recipe objects with complete data
- Provides clear error messages for invalid input
- Performance meets requirements for typical recipes
- Handles edge cases (empty files, missing sections)

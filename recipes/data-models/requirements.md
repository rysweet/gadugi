# Data Models Recipe Requirements

## Purpose
Define all data structures and models used by the Recipe Executor system to ensure type safety, validation, and clear contracts between components.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Recipe Data Model
- MUST define the Recipe class with metadata, requirements, design, and components
- MUST support recipe versioning and authorship metadata
- MUST handle recipe dependencies and build order
- MUST provide serialization/deserialization to/from JSON

### 2. Requirements Model
- MUST define Requirement class with priority levels (MUST, SHOULD, COULD)
- MUST support functional and non-functional requirement categories
- MUST track requirement status and validation results
- MUST provide requirement grouping by feature or component

### 3. Design Model
- MUST define ComponentDesign with interfaces and implementation details
- MUST support multiple component types (service, library, cli, agent)
- MUST track component dependencies and relationships
- MUST provide design validation against requirements

### 4. Execution Models
- MUST define ExecutionState for tracking recipe build progress
- MUST define GenerationResult for code generation outcomes
- MUST define TestResult for test execution tracking
- MUST support partial execution and incremental builds

### 5. Validation Models
- MUST define ValidationResult with errors, warnings, and info messages
- MUST support context-aware validation messages
- MUST track validation rule violations by severity
- MUST provide structured error reporting

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 6. Type Safety
- MUST use Pydantic v2 for runtime validation
- MUST provide comprehensive type hints for all models
- MUST validate all external data inputs
- SHOULD support custom validators for business rules

### 7. Performance
- MUST handle recipes with 100+ components efficiently
- MUST support lazy loading of large recipe components
- SHOULD cache parsed models for repeated access
- MUST minimize memory footprint for large recipes

### 8. Extensibility
- MUST allow custom model extensions without breaking changes
- MUST support forward/backward compatibility for model versions
- SHOULD provide model migration utilities
- MUST use composition over inheritance where possible

## Success Criteria
- All models have 100% type hint coverage
- Pydantic validation catches all invalid data
- Models can round-trip through JSON without data loss
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements for large recipes

# Systematic PR Review Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the systematic PR review workflow implemented to manage multiple open PRs efficiently while maintaining quality standards and governance compliance.

## Workflow Architecture

### Core Components
1. **OrchestratorAgent**: Central coordination for parallel PR processing
2. **WorkflowManager**: Individual PR workflow execution (11 phases)
3. **CodeReviewer**: Automated technical review execution
4. **WorktreeManager**: Isolated development environment management

### Process Flow
```
User Request → OrchestratorAgent → Multiple WorkflowManager instances → CodeReviewer → Results Aggregation
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
- **Purpose**: Environment validation and context establishment
- **Activities**:
  - Analyze systematic review requirements
  - Validate orchestrator configuration
  - Establish parallel execution framework

### Phase 2: Issue Management
- **Purpose**: Link workflow to tracking systems
- **Activities**:
  - Create or reference GitHub issues
  - Establish traceability
  - Document review scope

### Phase 3: Branch Management
- **Purpose**: Ensure proper git state for review execution
- **Activities**:
  - Validate worktree isolation
  - Confirm branch accessibility
  - Establish clean git state

### Phase 4: Research and Planning
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis of all target PRs
- **Activities**:
  - PR status analysis (conflicts, reviews, CI/CD)
  - Dependency mapping
  - Priority classification
  - Review strategy development

### Phase 5: Implementation
- **Purpose**: Execute systematic review process
- **Activities**:
  - Parallel WorkflowManager invocation
  - Individual PR workflow execution
  - Review documentation generation
  - Process limitation discovery

### Phase 6: Testing
- **Purpose**: Quality gate validation
- **Activities**:
  - UV environment setup and validation
  - pytest execution with coverage
  - ruff linting and formatting
  - pre-commit hook validation
  - Security scanning

### Phase 7: Documentation
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive workflow documentation
- **Activities**:
  - Analysis report generation
  - Process documentation creation
  - Implementation log maintenance
  - Improvement recommendations

### Phase 8: Pull Request
- **Purpose**: Formal review submission
- **Activities**:
  - PR creation with comprehensive description
  - Link to tracking issues
  - Quality validation summary
  - Implementation artifact inclusion

### Phase 9: Code Review
- **Purpose**: Technical review execution
- **Activities**:
  - CodeReviewer agent invocation
  - Systematic technical analysis
  - Security and quality assessment
  - Feedback documentation

### Phase 10: Review Response
- **Purpose**: Address feedback systematically
- **Activities**:
  - Review feedback analysis
  - Implementation of required changes
  - Response documentation
  - Re-review coordination

### Phase 11: Settings Update
- **Purpose**: Configuration and documentation updates
- **Activities**:
  - Memory.md updates
  - Process documentation updates
  - Configuration adjustments
  - Workflow completion validation

## Critical Discovery: Review Process Limitations

### Issue Identified
Code reviews executed in isolated worktrees cannot access PR branch content from other feature branches, blocking automated review execution for multiple PRs.

### Impact Analysis
- **Blocked Reviews**: PRs #286, #287 require manual intervention
- **Process Limitations**: Systematic automation partially compromised
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Need for improved branch access solutions

### Solution Framework
1. **Enhanced Branch Access**: Pre-review branch availability validation
2. **Manual Review Protocol**: Structured fallback procedures
3. **Environment Setup**: Improved worktree configuration
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Better integration with existing review systems

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Mandatory Quality Gates
1. **Testing**: All tests must pass before review
2. **Linting**: Code style compliance required
3. **Type Checking**: Pyright error baseline maintained
4. **Security**: Secrets scanning and security validation
5. **Pre-commit**: All hooks must pass

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Baseline maintenance required
- **Code Style**: 100% ruff compliance
- **Type Safety**: Pyright error reduction tracked
- **Security**: Zero secrets detected
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive coverage required

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Orchestrator Configuration
- **Process Registry**: Real-time execution monitoring
- **Heartbeat System**: Process health validation
- **Resource Management**: Concurrent execution limits
- **Failure Handling**: Graceful degradation support

### WorkflowManager Coordination
- **Isolated Execution**: Independent worktree environments
- **State Tracking**: Individual workflow progress monitoring
- **Result Aggregation**: Comprehensive outcome compilation
- **Error Handling**: Per-workflow failure management

## Documentation Standards

### Required Artifacts
1. **Analysis Reports**: Comprehensive PR analysis
2. **Implementation Logs**: Detailed execution tracking
3. **Quality Validation**: Test and compliance results
4. **Process Improvements**: Enhancement recommendations
5. **Strategic Planning**: Long-term implementation guidance

### Documentation Quality

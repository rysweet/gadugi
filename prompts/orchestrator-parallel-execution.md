# Orchestrator Parallel Execution Request

Execute the following two tasks in parallel to complete the Gadugi v0.3 implementation:

## Tasks to Execute

### Task 1: implement-task-decomposer-agent.md
- Implement the Task Decomposer agent (#240)
- Location: `.claude/agents/task-decomposer/`
- Requirements: Break complex tasks into subtasks, identify dependencies, estimate parallelization potential
- Must inherit from BaseAgent framework and be pyright clean

### Task 2: implement-team-coach-agent.md  
- Implement the Team Coach agent (#241)
- Location: `.claude/agents/team-coach/`
- Requirements: Auto-analyze sessions, identify improvements, create GitHub issues, track performance
- Must inherit from BaseAgent framework and be pyright clean

## Execution Requirements

1. **Parallel Execution**: Both tasks should be executed simultaneously in separate worktrees
2. **Quality Standards**: All code must pass `uv run pyright` with zero errors
3. **Testing**: Include comprehensive test suites for both agents
4. **Integration**: Both agents must integrate with Event Router and Memory System
5. **Documentation**: Complete documentation for both agents

## Expected Outcomes

- Two new agents fully implemented and tested
- Zero pyright errors in all new code
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Full integration with existing Gadugi v0.3 framework
- Recipe files properly configured
- Documentation complete

Please execute these tasks in parallel for maximum efficiency.

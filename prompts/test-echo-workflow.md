# WorkflowManager Task Execution

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: test-echo
- **Task Name**: test-echo
- **Original Prompt**: /Users/ryan/gadugi7/gadugi/.worktrees/task-test-echo/prompts/test-echo-workflow.md
- **Phase Focus**: Full Implementation

## Implementation Requirements

See original prompt for detailed requirements.

## Technical Specifications

See original prompt for technical details.

## Implementation Plan

Follow the implementation steps from the original prompt.

## Success Criteria

Complete all phases successfully with working implementation.

## Execution Instructions

**CRITICAL**: You are executing as WorkflowManager in a parallel execution environment.

1. **Complete All 9 Phases**: Execute the full WorkflowManager workflow
   - Phase 1: Initial Setup (analyze this prompt)
   - Phase 2: Issue Management (link to existing issue if provided)
   - Phase 3: Branch Management (you're already in the correct branch)
   - Phase 4: Research and Planning
   - Phase 5: **IMPLEMENTATION** (CREATE ACTUAL FILES - this is critical)
   - Phase 6: Testing
   - Phase 7: Documentation
   - Phase 8: Pull Request Creation
   - Phase 9: Code Review

2. **File Creation is Mandatory**: You MUST create actual implementation files, not just update Memory.md

3. **Context Preservation**: All implementation context is provided above

4. **Worktree Awareness**: You are executing in an isolated worktree environment

## Target Files
Target files will be determined during implementation phase.

## Dependencies
No specific dependencies identified.

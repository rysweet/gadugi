# WorkflowManager Task Execution

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: cleanup-all-worktrees
- **Task Name**: cleanup-all-worktrees
- **Original Prompt**: /Users/ryan/src/gadugi2/gadugi/.worktrees/task-cleanup-all-worktrees/prompts/cleanup-all-worktrees-workflow.md
- **Phase Focus**: Full Implementation

## Implementation Requirements

- Use `git worktree remove` for each
- Run `git worktree prune` after cleanup
- Verify cleanup with `git worktree list`
- Add cleanup phase to WorkflowManager for future
```

**Execute the complete WorkflowManager workflow for this task.**

## Technical Specifications

See original prompt for technical details.

## Implementation Plan

Follow the implementation steps from the original prompt.

## Success Criteria

Complete all phases successfully with working implementation.

## Execution Instructions

**CRITICAL**: You are executing as WorkflowManager in a parallel execution environment.

1. **Complete All 9 Phases**: Execute the full WorkflowManager workflow
   - Phase 1: Initial Setup (analyze this prompt)
   - Phase 2: Issue Management (link to existing issue if provided)
   - Phase 3: Branch Management (you're already in the correct branch)
   - Phase 4: Research and Planning
   - Phase 5: **IMPLEMENTATION** (CREATE ACTUAL FILES - this is critical)
   - Phase 6: Testing
   - Phase 7: Documentation
   - Phase 8: Pull Request Creation
   - Phase 9: Code Review

2. **File Creation is Mandatory**: You MUST create actual implementation files, not just update Memory.md

3. **Context Preservation**: All implementation context is provided above

4. **Worktree Awareness**: You are executing in an isolated worktree environment

## Target Files
Target files will be determined during implementation phase.

## Dependencies
No specific dependencies identified.

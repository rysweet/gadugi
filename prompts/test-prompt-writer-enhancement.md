# Test Enhancement for Prompt Writer GitHub Integration

This is a test prompt file created to validate the enhanced PromptWriter agent functionality implementing Issue #125.

## Problem Statement

The PromptWriter agent needed to be enhanced with automatic GitHub issue creation and integration capabilities to improve project tracking and workflow coordination.

## Feature Requirements

The enhanced PromptWriter agent should:
- Automatically create GitHub issues for new prompts (configurable via environment variable)
- Include issue numbers in prompt file frontmatter
- Prevent duplicate issue creation through search functionality
- Handle GitHub CLI unavailability gracefully
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows

## Technical Analysis

The implementation involved:
1. Adding GitHub CLI integration to the PromptWriter agent
2. Environment variable configuration for feature control
3. Duplicate detection using GitHub issue search
4. Enhanced frontmatter structure with issue metadata
5. Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Success Criteria

✅ Prompt writer agent enhanced with GitHub issue integration
✅ Environment variable PROMPT_WRITER_CREATE_ISSUES implemented
✅ Issue number included in prompt file frontmatter
✅ Duplicate prevention functionality working
✅ Error handling for GitHub CLI unavailability
✅ Backward compatibility maintained

This test validates that the enhancement has been successfully implemented.

# Reinforce Workflow for Code Changes

## Objective
Create a workflow enforcement mechanism to ensure all code changes follow the proper orchestrator → workflow-manager → 11 phases pattern.

## Requirements

1. **Research Phase**:
   - Review current workflow enforcement mechanisms
   - Identify gaps in workflow compliance
   - Study existing orchestrator and workflow-manager patterns
   - Analyze common workflow violations

2. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Create workflow enforcement mechanism
   - Add pre-execution checks for orchestrator usage
   - Implement automated reminders/warnings
   - Create workflow validation hooks
   - Add compliance monitoring

3. **Testing Phase**:
   - Test enforcement mechanisms
   - Validate workflow compliance checks
   - Test automated reminders
   - Verify no legitimate workflows are blocked
   - Test edge cases and exceptions

## Technical Details

### Workflow Phases (11 Required)
1. Initial Setup (task analysis)
2. Issue Creation
3. Branch Management (worktree)
4. Research and Planning
5. Implementation (with parallel pyright/formatting)
6. Testing
7. Documentation
8. Pull Request
9. Review (code-reviewer agent)
10. Review Response
11. Settings Update

### Enforcement Mechanisms
1. **Pre-execution Validation**:
   - Check for orchestrator invocation
   - Validate workflow-manager usage
   - Ensure worktree creation

2. **Runtime Monitoring**:
   - Track phase completion
   - Monitor compliance metrics
   - Log workflow violations

3. **Automated Reminders**:
   - Hook-based reminders
   - CLI warnings for direct execution
   - Documentation references

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Workflow enforcement mechanism implemented
- [ ] Pre-execution checks operational
- [ ] Automated reminders functional
- [ ] Compliance monitoring active
- [ ] Documentation comprehensive
- [ ] No false positives in enforcement

## Testing Requirements
- Enforcement mechanism tests
- Compliance validation tests
- Reminder system tests
- Integration tests with orchestrator
- Edge case handling

## Documentation Updates
- Workflow enforcement guide
- Best practices documentation
- Troubleshooting guide
- Compliance metrics documentation

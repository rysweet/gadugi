# Analyze Orchestrator/WorkflowManager Architecture

## Title and Overview

**Orchestrator/WorkflowManager Architecture Analysis and Optimization**

This prompt provides comprehensive analysis of the OrchestratorAgent and WorkflowManager architecture to identify merger opportunities, optimization potential, and architectural improvements. The analysis will inform decisions about potential consolidation or enhanced separation of concerns.

**Context**: With the successful resolution of the OrchestratorAgent implementation issue (PR #10), both agents are now functioning effectively. This presents an opportunity to analyze their architecture for potential optimizations, code sharing, or strategic merger to improve maintainability and performance.

## Problem Statement

The current dual-agent architecture raises several architectural questions:

1. **Code Duplication**: Potential overlap in functionality between OrchestratorAgent and WorkflowManager
2. **Complexity Management**: Two agents with similar concerns may increase maintenance overhead
3. **Integration Overhead**: Coordination between agents may introduce unnecessary complexity
4. **Performance Impact**: Multiple agent invocations may affect overall system performance
5. **Unclear Boundaries**: Potential confusion about when to use which agent

**Current Uncertainty**: Without thorough architectural analysis, it's unclear whether the current separation optimally serves the system's needs or if consolidation would improve efficiency and maintainability.

# Test Subprocess Execution

This is a simple test prompt to verify that the orchestrator can properly spawn subprocess instances.

## Requirements
- Create a simple test file
- Verify WorkflowManager delegation works
- Test real subprocess execution

## Implementation
Create a file called test_subprocess_result.txt with the content "Hello from subprocess execution!"

This test will validate that:
1. Real subprocess spawning works
2. WorkflowManager delegation happens
3. Parallel execution is possible

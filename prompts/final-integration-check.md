Verify all components work together.

Checklist:
1. Neo4j connectivity on port 7475
2. Event Router process spawning
3. MCP Service API endpoints
4. Team Coach phase 13 integration
5. Orchestrator parallel execution
6. Recipe Executor code generation

Verification steps:
- Test Neo4j connection: `docker exec gadugi-neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p gadugi-password "MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)"`
- Run validation script: `uv run python validate_v03_implementation.py`
- Check all components have implementations
- Verify Team Coach is properly integrated

This is a UV project - use `uv run` for all Python commands

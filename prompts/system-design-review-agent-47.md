# System Design Review Agent Implementation

## Issue Context
Implementing issue #47: System Design Review Agent

## Background
The Gadugi system requires a specialized agent that maintains architectural coherence and system design integrity as the codebase evolves through continuous pull requests. This agent will automatically review PRs for architectural impact and update system design documentation accordingly.

## Objectives
Create a System Design Review Agent that:
- Automatically triggers on every pull request
- Analyzes code changes for architectural impact
- Updates system design documentation to reflect changes
- Ensures design docs remain accurate and coherent
- Identifies potential architectural drift or violations

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Agent Specification
Create `.claude/agents/system-design-reviewer.md` with:
- Clear role definition for architectural review
- Integration points with orchestrator/workflow manager
- AST parsing capabilities for code analysis
- Documentation update procedures

### 2. Core Functionality
Implement the following capabilities:
- **PR Analysis**: Parse PR diffs to identify architectural changes
- **Design Impact Assessment**: Evaluate changes against design principles
- **Documentation Updates**: Maintain ARCHITECTURE.md automatically
- **ADR Generation**: Create Architecture Decision Records for significant changes
- **Review Comments**: Provide automated design feedback on PRs

### 3. GitHub Actions Integration
- Create workflow that triggers on PR events
- Integrate with existing agent invocation patterns
- Ensure <5 minute review completion time

### 4. AST Parsing Implementation
- Create pluggable AST parsing abstraction
- Support multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, etc.)
- Extract architectural patterns and dependencies
- Identify component interactions and changes

### 5. Documentation Management
- Create/update ARCHITECTURE.md with system overview
- Generate component diagrams (Mermaid)
- Track design evolution with versioning
- Maintain design decision history

### 6. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for AST parsing logic
- Integration tests with GitHub API
- End-to-end workflow tests
- Achieve >80% code coverage
- Test accuracy of architectural change detection

### 7. Integration Points
- Enhanced Separation shared modules for error handling
- Existing StateManager for tracking review state
- GitHubOperations for PR interactions
- Container execution environment for security

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Agent specification created and documented
- [ ] AST parsing implementation with pluggable architecture
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow integrated
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md auto-update functionality
- [ ] ADR generation for significant changes
- [ ] 95%+ accuracy in identifying architectural changes
- [ ] <5 minute PR review completion
- [ ] >80% test coverage
- [ ] Integration with existing agent ecosystem

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Agent Definition
- Create agent specification following existing patterns
- Define integration points with orchestrator
- Document expected inputs/outputs

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- Build AST parsing abstraction layer
- Implement change detection algorithms
- Create documentation update logic

### Phase 3: GitHub Integration
- Create Actions workflow
- Implement PR comment generation
- Add file update capabilities

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- Comprehensive test suite
- Performance optimization
- Integration testing with other agents

## Dependencies
- Python AST module for code analysis
- GitHub API for PR interactions
- Mermaid for diagram generation
- Enhanced Separation architecture components

# WorkflowManager Task Execution

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: fix-types-misc-files
- **Task Name**: fix-types-misc-files
- **Original Prompt**: /Users/ryan/src/gadugi/.worktrees/task-fix-types-misc-files/prompts/fix-types-misc-files-workflow.md
- **Phase Focus**: Full Implementation

## Implementation Requirements

- All functionality must be preserved
- Performance benchmarks must still run correctly
- Agent behavior must remain unchanged
- All tests must continue to pass
```

---

**Execute the complete WorkflowManager workflow for this task.**

## Technical Specifications

See original prompt for technical details.

## Implementation Plan

Follow the implementation steps from the original prompt.

## Success Criteria

Complete all phases successfully with working implementation.

## Execution Instructions

**CRITICAL**: You are executing as WorkflowManager in a parallel execution environment.

1. **Complete All 9 Phases**: Execute the full WorkflowManager workflow
   - Phase 1: Initial Setup (analyze this prompt)
   - Phase 2: Issue Management (link to existing issue if provided)
   - Phase 3: Branch Management (you're already in the correct branch)
   - Phase 4: Research and Planning
   - Phase 5: **IMPLEMENTATION** (CREATE ACTUAL FILES - this is critical)
   - Phase 6: Testing
   - Phase 7: Documentation
   - Phase 8: Pull Request Creation
   - Phase 9: Code Review

2. **File Creation is Mandatory**: You MUST create actual implementation files, not just update Memory.md

3. **Context Preservation**: All implementation context is provided above

4. **Worktree Awareness**: You are executing in an isolated worktree environment

## Target Files
Target files will be determined during implementation phase.

## Dependencies
No specific dependencies identified.

## Target Files
Expected files to be created/modified:
- `benchmark_performance.py`
- `src/agents/program_manager.py`
- `tests/test_teamcoach_hooks_comprehensive.py`
- `tests/agents/test_test_agents_basic.py`
- `program_manager.py`


## Dependencies
No specific dependencies identified.

## Original Prompt Content

# Fix Type Errors in Miscellaneous Files

## Objective
Fix remaining type errors in various files across the codebase.

## Target Files
- benchmark_performance.py (import errors)
- src/agents/program_manager.py (7 errors)
- tests/test_teamcoach_hooks_comprehensive.py (13 errors)
- tests/agents/test_test_agents_basic.py (9 errors)
- Various other files with 1-5 errors each

## Focus Areas
1. **Import resolution**: Fix import paths for moved modules
2. **Type annotations**: Add missing function and variable annotations
3. **Generic types**: Specify generic type parameters
4. **Protocol compliance**: Ensure classes implement required protocols

## Strategy
1. Fix all import errors by updating to correct paths
2. Add comprehensive type annotations to all functions
3. Specify generic types for collections (List, Dict, etc.)
4. Use Union types where multiple types are accepted
5. Add dataclass annotations where appropriate

## Specific Issues
- benchmark_performance.py: Update imports to use .claude.shared paths
- program_manager.py: Add type hints to agent coordination methods
- Hook tests: Fix mock type annotations and assertions
- Basic agent tests: Add proper fixture typing

## Requirements
- All functionality must be preserved
- Performance benchmarks must still run correctly
- Agent behavior must remain unchanged
- All tests must continue to pass

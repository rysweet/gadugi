# OrchestratorAgent for Parallel WorkflowManager Execution

## Overview

The OrchestratorAgent is a sophisticated coordination system for the Gadugi project that enables parallel execution of multiple WorkflowManagers. This agent addresses the current sequential execution limitation by intelligently analyzing task dependencies, managing git worktrees, and coordinating multiple Claude Code CLI instances running in parallel.

## Problem Statement

Currently, WorkflowManagers execute sequentially, which creates significant inefficiencies when multiple independent tasks could run simultaneously. For example:

- Writing tests for different modules (e.g., `definition_node.py`, `relationship_creator.py`, `documentation_linker.py`)
- Fixing unrelated bugs in separate components
- Implementing separate features that don't share file dependencies
- Running different types of analysis or refactoring tasks

This sequential approach can result in 3-5x longer execution times for independent tasks, reducing developer productivity and delaying project completion.

## Technical Context

### Available Technologies
- **Claude Code CLI Non-Interactive Mode**: `claude -p "prompt" --output-format json`
- **Git Worktrees**: `git worktree add .worktrees/task-N -b branch-name` for isolated working directories
- **JSON Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking through structured output
- **Existing Sub-Agents**: WorkflowManager, PromptWriter, CodeReviewer available for orchestration

### Current System State
- 5+ test coverage tasks identified that could run in parallel
- Existing `/prompts/` directory structure with task definitions
- Functional WorkflowManager sub-agent with proven workflow execution
- Git repository with clean branching strategy

    dependency_graph = {}

    for prompt in prompts:
        # Extract target files from prompt content
        target_files = extract_target_files(prompt)

        # Analyze import relationships
        imports = analyze_imports(target_files)

        # Check test file relationships
        test_dependencies = map_test_dependencies(target_files)

        # Build conflict matrix
        conflicts = detect_file_conflicts(target_files, existing_tasks)

        dependency_graph[prompt.id] = {
            'files': target_files,
            'imports': imports,
            'tests': test_dependencies,

## Error Handling Strategies

### 1. Graceful Degradation
```python
def handle_resource_exhaustion():
    """When system resources are low, gracefully reduce parallelism"""
    if system_cpu_usage() > 90%:
        reduce_concurrent_tasks(by=50%)
    if memory_usage() > 85%:
        switch_to_sequential_mode()
    if disk_space_low():
        cleanup_temporary_worktrees()
```

### 2. Failure Isolation
```python
def isolate_task_failure(failed_task):
    """Prevent one failed task from affecting others"""
    mark_task_as_failed(failed_task)
    cleanup_failed_worktree(failed_task)
    redistribute_dependencies(failed_task)
    continue_with_remaining_tasks()
```

### 3. Rollback Mechanisms
```python
def emergency_rollback():
    """Complete system rollback if critical failures occur"""
    stop_all_parallel_executions()
    cleanup_all_worktrees()
    restore_main_branch_state()
    create_failure_report()
```

### 4. Progressive Retry
```python
def retry_failed_task(task, attempt=1):
    """Smart retry with exponential backoff"""
    if attempt > 3:
        mark_permanent_failure(task)
        return False

    wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # Exponential backoff
    time.sleep(wait_time)

    if is_transient_failure(task.last_error):
        return retry_task_execution(task, attempt + 1)
    else:
        return handle_permanent_failure(task)
```

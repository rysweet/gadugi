# WorkflowManager Task Execution

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: add-v0.1-release-notes
- **Task Name**: add-v0.1-release-notes

- **Phase Focus**: Full Implementation

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Research the v0.1 milestone**:
   - Use `gh api repos/rydcormier/gadugi/milestones` to get milestone information
   - Use `gh issue list --milestone "v0.1" --state all` to see what was included
   - Review recent commits and merged PRs associated with v0.1

2. **Create Release Notes Section**:
   - Add a new "## ðŸ“¦ Release Notes" section near the top of README.md
   - Write 1-2 concise paragraphs summarizing the v0.1 release
   - Focus on key features and improvements
   - Keep it brief and user-focused
   - Include the release date

3. **Content Guidelines**:
   - Highlight the most important capabilities added
   - Mention the orchestrator-based workflow system
   - Note the VS Code extension integration
   - Reference the 11-phase development workflow
   - Keep technical details minimal - focus on what users can do

4. **Placement**:
   - Place the release notes section after the badges but before the main project description
   - Ensure smooth flow with existing README content

## Technical Specifications

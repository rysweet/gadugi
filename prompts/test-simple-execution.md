# Simple Execution Test

This is a minimal test task for validating subprocess execution.

## Task
Create a simple text file to demonstrate that the orchestrator subprocess execution works.

## Requirements
- Create a file named `orchestrator_test_result.txt`
- Add the content "Subprocess execution successful!"

This validates:
1. Real subprocess spawning
2. WorkflowManager delegation
3. File creation capability

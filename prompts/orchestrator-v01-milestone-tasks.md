# Orchestrator Execution: v0.1 Milestone Tasks

## Task Analysis for Parallel Execution

Execute these v0.1 milestone tasks with appropriate prioritization:

### Task 1: PR #207 Code Review Response (BLOCKING - Sequential First)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must complete first as it's blocking v0.1
**Dependencies**: None - standalone task
**Estimated Complexity**: HIGH (file cleanup, reference verification, testing)

Required Actions:
- Remove duplicate files from root (they should only exist in new locations)
- Verify all references in CLAUDE.md, README.md, and other files
- Add migration documentation
- Run full test suite to confirm functionality
- Respond to code review feedback on PR #207

### Task 2: README Humility Update (Issue #208)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Can run in parallel after Task 1
**Dependencies**: None - independent from other tasks
**Estimated Complexity**: LOW-MEDIUM (content editing)

Required Actions:
- Remove "3-5x faster" performance claims
- Remove "production ready" / "enterprise grade" language
- Remove "blazing fast" marketing speak
- Apply humble, factual tone
- Focus on actual features, not claims

### Task 3: Comprehensive Documentation (Issue #128)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Can run in parallel with Task 2
**Dependencies**: May reference files from Task 1 cleanup
**Estimated Complexity**: HIGH (multiple file creation)

Required Documentation Files:
- `docs/getting-started.md` - Installation and setup guide
- `docs/architecture.md` - System design and components
- `docs/agents/README.md` - Complete agent catalog
- `docs/workflows.md` - Common workflow patterns
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `docs/api-reference.md` - CLI and agent interfaces
- `docs/contributing.md` - Contribution guidelines

Plus README.md updates for project overview and quick start.

## Execution Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Execute Task 1 (PR #207 fixes) FIRST and SEQUENTIALLY
   - Critical blocking issue for v0.1
   - Must ensure code review feedback is fully addressed
   - Verify all file movements and reference updates

2. **Phase 2**: Execute Tasks 2 and 3 in PARALLEL after Task 1 completion
   - Task 2 (README humility) and Task 3 (comprehensive docs) are independent
   - Both contribute to v0.1 milestone readiness
   - Can leverage parallel execution for efficiency

## Success Criteria

- PR #207 code review feedback fully resolved
- All duplicate files removed, references verified
- README.md reflects humble, accurate project description
- Comprehensive documentation structure established
- All tests passing, quality gates met
- v0.1 milestone unblocked and ready for release

Execute with full 11-phase workflow for each task.

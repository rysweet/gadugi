# Analyze and Categorize All Type Errors

## Context
Perform comprehensive analysis of all 6,794 pyright type issues (1,042 errors + 5,710 warnings) in the Gadugi project, categorizing them systematically to enable targeted fixing strategies.

## Requirements

### 1. Comprehensive Analysis
Run pyright with detailed output and analyze:
- Complete error inventory with file locations
- Error type classification and frequency analysis
- Dependency relationships between errors
- Complexity assessment for each error category

### 2. Error Categorization
Classify all errors into these categories:

#### Import-Related Issues
- Missing imports (`import "X" could not be resolved`)
- Circular import dependencies
- Incorrect import paths
- Unused imports

#### Type Annotation Issues
- Missing parameter type annotations
- Missing return type annotations
- Missing class attribute type annotations
- Missing variable type annotations

#### Type Resolution Issues
- Unknown/unresolved types
- Incorrect generic type usage
- Type compatibility mismatches
- Protocol violations

#### Complex Type Issues
- Abstract method implementations
- Interface compliance problems
- Inheritance type conflicts
- Decorator type issues

### 3. Priority Classification
Assign priority levels:
- **P0 Critical**: Import errors blocking further analysis
- **P1 High**: Core module type errors affecting functionality
- **P2 Medium**: Test file type errors and warnings
- **P3 Low**: Style and consistency improvements

### 4. Fix Strategy Development
For each category, determine:
- Automated fix feasibility (can script handle it?)
- Manual intervention requirements
- Dependencies between fixes
- Risk assessment for each fix type

### 5. Progress Tracking Setup
Create systems for:
- Baseline error counts by category
- Progress measurement after fixes
- Success/failure tracking per fix type
- Rollback identification for problematic changes

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Raw Data Collection
- Run pyright with JSON output for machine processing
- Export all error details with locations and error codes
- Create comprehensive error database/spreadsheet

### Task 2: Automated Categorization
- Parse pyright output to extract error patterns
- Group errors by type, file, and severity
- Calculate frequency distributions and hotspots

### Task 3: Dependency Analysis
- Identify files with the most import errors
- Map type dependencies between modules
- Find circular dependency chains

### Task 4: Fix Complexity Assessment
- Identify errors fixable with simple automation
- Mark errors requiring manual analysis
- Estimate effort levels for different fix types

### Task 5: Priority Ordering
- Create fix order based on dependency analysis
- Prioritize import fixes to unblock other analysis
- Sequence core modules before test modules

## Deliverables

1. **Comprehensive Error Database**
   - All 6,794 errors categorized and classified
   - File-by-file breakdown with priority assignments
   - Error frequency analysis and patterns identified

2. **Fix Strategy Document**
   - Detailed plan for each error category
   - Automated vs manual fix identification
   - Dependencies and sequencing requirements

3. **Baseline Metrics**
   - Current error counts by type and file
   - Progress tracking framework
   - Success criteria definitions

4. **Priority Implementation Plan**
   - Phase 1: Import error fixes (blocking)
   - Phase 2: Core module type annotations
   - Phase 3: Test file type improvements
   - Phase 4: Style and consistency fixes

## Success Criteria
- 100% of errors categorized and classified
- Clear fix strategy for each error type
- Priority order established with dependencies mapped
- Baseline metrics established for progress tracking
- Automated fix scripts identified for bulk operations

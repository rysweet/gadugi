# Migrate Gadugi to UV (Ultraviolet) Packaging System

## Overview

This prompt guides the complete migration of the Gadugi multi-agent system from traditional pip-based dependency management to UV (ultraviolet), a Rust-based Python packaging tool that provides 10-100x faster package resolution and installation. This migration will modernize the project's Python tooling while maintaining compatibility with existing development workflows and CI/CD processes.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **Manual Dependency Management**: The project currently relies on scattered requirements.txt files and manual pip installation
- **Slow Environment Setup**: Traditional pip-based workflows are slow for developers and CI/CD
- **No Lock File**: Missing reproducible builds due to lack of dependency locking
- **Inconsistent Python Environments**: No standardized virtual environment management across the project
- **Limited Dependency Resolution**: Basic pip dependency resolution can lead to conflicts

### Current State Analysis
The Gadugi project currently has:
- Python test infrastructure with pytest
- Memory manager component with PyYAML dependency (`/.github/memory-manager/requirements.txt`)
- Orchestrator components with complex Python modules
- Integration testing framework
- No centralized dependency management or lock files
- Manual environment setup processes

### Impact on Development Workflow
- Developers experience slow environment setup
- CI/CD pipelines spend excessive time on dependency installation
- Risk of dependency conflicts and version drift
- Difficulty reproducing exact dependency states across environments
- Lack of modern Python tooling standards

### Motivation for UV Migration
UV provides significant advantages:
- **Performance**: 10-100x faster than pip for package operations
- **Modern Standards**: Built-in support for pyproject.toml and PEP standards
- **Reproducible Builds**: Automatic lock file generation (uv.lock)
- **Better Resolution**: Advanced dependency resolver prevents conflicts
- **Integrated Tooling**: Combined package management and virtual environment handling
- **Future-Proof**: Rust-based implementation with active development

- `uv python install 3.11` - Install Python version

## Development Workflow
1. `uv sync --extra dev` - Setup development environment
2. `uv run pytest` - Run tests
3. `uv run black .` - Format code
4. `uv add --group dev new-tool` - Add development tool

## Troubleshooting
- `uv cache clean` - Clear UV cache
- `uv venv --force` - Recreate virtual environment
- `uv lock --upgrade` - Upgrade all dependencies
```

### Phase 7: Testing and Validation

#### Step 7.1: Comprehensive Test Execution
**Action**: Run complete test suite with UV
**Commands**:
```bash
# Full test suite
uv run pytest tests/ -v --cov=. --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Integration test
uv run python test_orchestrator_fix_integration.py

# Specific test categories
uv run pytest tests/integration/ -m integration
uv run pytest tests/shared/ -m unit
```

#### Step 7.2: Performance Benchmarking
**Action**: Measure UV performance improvements
**Script**: Create benchmarking script to compare pip vs UV
**Metrics**:
- Cold install time (no cache)
- Warm install time (with cache)
- Lock file generation time
- Environment creation time

#### Step 7.3: Cross-Platform Testing
**Action**: Verify UV works on all supported platforms
**Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows
**Tests**:
- UV installation successful
- Dependencies install correctly
- Tests pass on all platforms
- Lock file consistency across platforms

### Phase 8: Pull Request Creation

#### Step 8.1: Commit Changes
**Action**: Create clean commit history for UV migration
**Commands**:
```bash
# Stage migration files
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock gadugi/__init__.py

# Stage documentation
git add docs/uv-*.md

# Stage CI/CD updates
git add .github/workflows/

# Stage cleanup
git add . # (after removing old requirements.txt files)

# Create comprehensive commit
git commit -m "feat: migrate to UV for Python packaging and dependency management

- Create pyproject.toml with centralized dependency management
- Generate uv.lock for reproducible builds
- Update GitHub Actions workflows to use UV
- Add comprehensive UV documentation and migration guide
- Remove legacy requirements.txt files
- Add proper Python package structure

Performance improvements:
- 50-90% faster dependency installation
- Improved CI/CD pipeline speed
- Better dependency resolution and conflict handling

Breaking changes: None (full backward compatibility maintained)

Closes #34

## Changes Made

### Core Migration
- ✅ Created centralized `pyproject.toml` configuration
- ✅ Generated `uv.lock` for reproducible builds
- ✅ Added proper Python package structure (`gadugi/__init__.py`)
- ✅ Migrated all dependencies from requirements.txt files

### CI/CD Updates
- ✅ Updated GitHub Actions workflows to use UV
- ✅ Added UV caching strategy for faster CI runs
- ✅ Cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- ✅ Maintained existing test coverage requirements

### Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive UV installation guide
- ✅ Added developer migration documentation
- ✅ Updated project setup instructions
- ✅ Created UV command cheat sheet

### Performance Improvements
- 🚀 50-90% faster dependency installation
- 🚀 Improved CI/CD pipeline speed
- 🚀 Better dependency resolution and conflict handling
- 🚀 Reproducible builds with lock file

## Testing
- ✅ All existing tests pass with UV environment
- ✅ Integration tests validated
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility verified

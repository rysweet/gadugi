# Systematic PR Review and Response Workflow

## Objective
Execute comprehensive review and response workflow for all 12 open PRs to ensure proper commit, push, review, and review response cycles as required.

## Context
Currently have 12 open PRs that need proper review workflow execution:
- PR #287: Orchestrator subprocess execution fixes
- PR #286: Code quality compliance foundation
- PR #282: Neo4j service implementation
- PR #281: Team Coach agent implementation
- PR #280: Event router type fixes
- PR #279: Pyright error reduction
- PR #278: Test infrastructure fixes
- PR #270: Pyright error reduction (442â†’178)
- PR #269: System design review
- PR #268: Testing and QA
- PR #247: Task decomposer agent
- PR #184: Gadugi v0.3 regeneration

## Requirements

### Phase 1: PR Analysis and Categorization
1. **Analyze each PR** for:
   - Commit status and completeness
   - Code review status
   - CI/CD pipeline status
   - Merge conflicts or dependencies

2. **Categorize PRs** by priority:
   - **Critical**: Core infrastructure (orchestrator, type fixes)
   - **Important**: Feature implementations (Team Coach, Neo4j)
   - **Enhancement**: Process improvements (testing, docs)
   - **Consolidation**: Overlapping work that can be merged

### Phase 2: Review Workflow Execution
For each PR, execute proper review workflow:

1. **Code Review Phase**:
   - Use code-reviewer agent for comprehensive technical review
   - Focus on implementation quality, security, maintainability
   - Document findings in structured review comments

2. **Review Response Phase**:
   - Address all review feedback systematically
   - Make required code changes via proper workflow
   - Update PR with response comments

3. **Quality Gate Validation**:
   - Verify all CI/CD checks pass
   - Ensure pre-commit hooks pass
   - Validate type checking compliance

### Phase 3: PR Consolidation Strategy
1. **Identify overlapping work** (e.g., multiple pyright error reduction PRs)
2. **Create consolidation plan** to merge related work
3. **Close redundant PRs** with proper documentation
4. **Update remaining PRs** with consolidated changes

### Phase 4: Completion and Merge Strategy
1. **Prioritize critical infrastructure PRs** (orchestrator fixes)
2. **Sequence dependent PRs** (type fixes before features)
3. **Execute merge workflow** with proper testing
4. **Clean up completed branches** and worktrees

## Success Criteria
- All 12 PRs have comprehensive code reviews
- All review feedback has proper responses
- Critical PRs are merged and functioning
- Redundant PRs are consolidated or closed
- Clean PR queue with <6 active PRs
- All workflow phases properly executed

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Execute via WorkflowManager**: Each PR review as separate workflow
2. **Use code-reviewer agent**: For systematic technical reviews
3. **Follow 11-phase workflow**: For all review and response activities
4. **Maintain governance**: All changes through proper workflow delegation
5. **Quality gates**: Enforce type checking, testing, pre-commit compliance

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - Proper workflow execution is mandatory for maintaining development governance and ensuring all work follows the established 11-phase workflow pattern.

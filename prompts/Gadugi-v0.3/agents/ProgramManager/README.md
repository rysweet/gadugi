# ProgramManager

This directory contains the program-manager agent definition.

## Files

- `ProgramManager.md` - The agent definition (this IS the agent)
- `src/` - Extracted Python code modules

## Usage

This agent can be invoked using:
```
/agent:program-manager
```

## Note

The `ProgramManager.md` file is not documentation ABOUT the agent - it IS the agent itself.
It contains the complete instructions and logic that Claude Code uses when this agent is invoked.

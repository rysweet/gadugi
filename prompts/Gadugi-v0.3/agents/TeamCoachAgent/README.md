# TeamcoachAgent

This directory contains the teamcoach-agent agent definition.

## Files

- `TeamcoachAgent.md` - The agent definition (this IS the agent)
- `src/` - Extracted Python code modules

## Usage

This agent can be invoked using:

```

## Note

The `TeamcoachAgent.md` file is not documentation ABOUT the agent - it IS the agent itself.

# WorkflowManager

This directory contains the workflow-manager agent definition.

## Files

- `WorkflowManager.md` - The agent definition (this IS the agent)
- `src/` - Extracted Python code modules

## Usage

This agent can be invoked using:
```
/agent:workflow-manager
```

## Note

The `WorkflowManager.md` file is not documentation ABOUT the agent - it IS the agent itself.
It contains the complete instructions and logic that Claude Code uses when this agent is invoked.

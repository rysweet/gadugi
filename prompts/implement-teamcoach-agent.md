# Implement TeamCoach Agent

## Title and Overview

**TeamCoach Agent Implementation**

This prompt implements a TeamCoach agent that provides intelligent coordination, guidance, and optimization for multi-agent development teams. The agent will analyze team performance, identify optimization opportunities, and provide coaching for improved collaboration and productivity.

**Context**: As the Gadugi multi-agent system grows in complexity and capability, effective team coordination becomes crucial. A TeamCoach agent will provide the intelligence needed to optimize team performance, resolve conflicts, and guide strategic decisions about agent utilization.

## Problem Statement

Multi-agent development teams face several coordination and optimization challenges:

1. **Suboptimal Agent Utilization**: Agents may be underutilized or misaligned with appropriate tasks
2. **Coordination Overhead**: Poor coordination leads to conflicts, duplicated effort, and inefficiency
3. **Performance Blind Spots**: No systematic analysis of team performance and bottlenecks
4. **Skill Gap Management**: Difficulty matching tasks to agent capabilities optimally
5. **Strategic Planning**: Lack of intelligent guidance for team composition and task assignment

**Current Impact**: Without intelligent team coordination, multi-agent systems operate below optimal efficiency and may develop coordination problems that compound over time.

## Feature Requirements

### Team Analysis Requirements
- **Performance Analytics**: Analyze individual agent and team performance metrics
- **Capability Assessment**: Evaluate agent strengths, weaknesses, and specializations
- **Workflow Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in team workflows
- **Collaboration Pattern Analysis**: Understand how agents work together most effectively
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor and optimize resource usage across the team

### Coaching Requirements
- **Strategic Guidance**: Provide recommendations for team composition and task assignment
- **Performance Coaching**: Identify areas for improvement and optimization strategies
- **Conflict Resolution**: Detect and help resolve agent conflicts and coordination issues
- **Skill Development**: Guide agent enhancement and capability development
- **Best Practices**: Share and enforce best practices across the team

### Coordination Requirements

        # Score all agents for this task
        agent_scores = {}
        for agent in self.available_agents:
            score = self.calculate_agent_task_fit(agent, task_profile)
            agent_scores[agent.id] = score

        # Return top candidates with reasoning
        return self.rank_and_explain_recommendations(agent_scores, task_profile)
```

```python
class TeamCompositionOptimizer:
    def optimize_team_for_project(self, project_requirements):
        """Optimize team composition for a specific project"""

        # Analyze project complexity and requirements
        project_analysis = self.analyze_project_requirements(project_requirements)

        # Generate possible team compositions

        # Score team compositions
        scored_teams = self.score_team_compositions(team_options, project_analysis)

        # Return optimal team with explanation

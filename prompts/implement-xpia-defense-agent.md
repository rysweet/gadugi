# Implement XPIA Defense Agent

## Title and Overview

**XPIA Defense Agent Implementation**

This prompt implements a Cross-Prompt Injection Attack (XPIA) defense agent to protect the Gadugi multi-agent system from malicious prompt injections. The agent will function as security middleware, analyzing and sanitizing all agent communications to prevent injection attacks.

**Context**: Multi-agent systems are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks where malicious input can manipulate agent behavior. As Gadugi grows in capability and complexity, implementing robust security defenses becomes critical for safe operation.

## Problem Statement

The Gadugi multi-agent system currently lacks protection against cross-prompt injection attacks, creating security vulnerabilities:

1. **Injection Vectors**: User input, file content, and agent communications can contain malicious prompts
2. **Agent Manipulation**: Attackers could redirect agent behavior, extract sensitive information, or cause unintended actions
3. **System Compromise**: Successful injections could compromise the entire multi-agent workflow
4. **Trust Erosion**: Lack of security measures reduces confidence in system safety

**Current Risk**: Without XPIA defense, the system is vulnerable to sophisticated prompt injection attacks that could manipulate agent behavior or extract sensitive information.

## Feature Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify common injection patterns and techniques
- **Content Sanitization**: Clean potentially malicious content while preserving legitimate functionality
- **Agent Communication Filtering**: Monitor and filter all inter-agent communications
- **Real-time Protection**: Provide security validation without significant performance impact
- **Logging and Alerting**: Track attempted attacks for analysis and response

### Technical Requirements
- **Integration Point**: Function as middleware between agents and the Claude Code execution environment
- **Performance**: Add <100ms latency to agent communications
- **Accuracy**: Minimize false positives while catching genuine threats
- **Extensibility**: Support adding new detection patterns and rules
- **Configuration**: Allow security policy customization

### Security Requirements
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple detection layers for robust protection
- **Fail-Safe**: Default to blocking suspicious content when in doubt
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all security decisions
- **Regular Updates**: Mechanism for updating threat patterns

## Technical Analysis

### Current Security Landscape
- **No XPIA Protection**: System currently trusts all input and agent communications
- **Shell Execution**: agent-manager executes shell scripts with minimal validation
- **File Processing**: Agents process files without content validation
- **Inter-Agent Trust**: Agents implicitly trust communications from other agents

### Proposed Defense Architecture
```
User Input/File Content → XPIA Defense Agent → Sanitized Content → Target Agent
                    ↓
              Threat Analysis → Security Log → Alert System
```

### Detection Strategies
1. **Pattern Matching**: Known injection patterns and techniques
2. **Semantic Analysis**: Context-aware evaluation of suspicious content
3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Detect attempts to manipulate agent behavior
4. **Content Structure**: Identify malformed or unusual prompt structures

### Integration Approach
- **Transparent Middleware**: Minimal changes to existing agent code
- **Hook Integration**: Leverage existing agent-manager hook system
- **Configuration-Driven**: Policy-based security rules

## Threat Pattern Library

### Initial Patterns to Detect
1. **Direct Injection**: Attempts to override system prompts
2. **Role Playing**: Attempts to change agent identity or role
3. **Instruction Hijacking**: Attempts to redirect agent tasks
4. **Information Extraction**: Attempts to extract sensitive information
5. **Command Injection**: Attempts to execute unauthorized commands
6. **Context Poisoning**: Attempts to corrupt agent context or memory

4. **Semantic Confusion**: Exploiting natural language ambiguity

## Configuration and Policy Management

### Security Policies
- **Strict Mode**: Block all suspicious content (high security)
- **Balanced Mode**: Block obvious threats, warn on suspicious content
- **Permissive Mode**: Log threats but allow execution (development only)

### Configurable Elements
- **Threat Patterns**: Add/remove detection patterns
- **Whitelist Rules**: Exception patterns for legitimate use cases
- **Logging Levels**: Control verbosity of security logging
- **Performance Tuning**: Adjust detection depth vs. speed tradeoffs

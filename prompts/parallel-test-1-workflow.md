# WorkflowManager Task Execution

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: parallel-test-1
- **Task Name**: parallel-test-1
- **Original Prompt**: /Users/ryan/gadugi7/gadugi/.claude/orchestrator/.worktrees/task-parallel-test-1/prompts/parallel-test-1-workflow.md
- **Phase Focus**: Full Implementation

## Implementation Requirements

See original prompt for detailed requirements.

## Technical Specifications

See original prompt for technical details.

## Implementation Plan

Follow the implementation steps from the original prompt.

## Success Criteria

Complete all phases successfully with working implementation.

## Execution Instructions

**CRITICAL**: You are executing as WorkflowManager in a parallel execution environment.

1. **Complete All 9 Phases**: Execute the full WorkflowManager workflow
   - Phase 1: Initial Setup (analyze this prompt)
   - Phase 2: Issue Management (link to existing issue if provided)
   - Phase 3: Branch Management (you're already in the correct branch)
   - Phase 4: Research and Planning
   - Phase 5: **IMPLEMENTATION** (CREATE ACTUAL FILES - this is critical)
   - Phase 6: Testing
   - Phase 7: Documentation
   - Phase 8: Pull Request Creation
   - Phase 9: Code Review

2. **File Creation is Mandatory**: You MUST create actual implementation files, not just update Memory.md

3. **Context Preservation**: All implementation context is provided above

4. **Worktree Awareness**: You are executing in an isolated worktree environment

## Target Files
Target files will be determined during implementation phase.

## Dependencies
No specific dependencies identified.

# Parallel Test Task 1

Write the current timestamp to `/tmp/parallel-task-1.txt` with the exact time this task starts executing.

Use this Python code:
```python
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path

timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()
Path('/tmp/parallel-task-1.txt').write_text(f"Task 1 executed at: {timestamp}\n")
print(f"Task 1 executed at: {timestamp}")
```

Then wait 3 seconds and write completion time:
```python
import time
time.sleep(3)
completion = datetime.now().isoformat()
Path('/tmp/parallel-task-1-done.txt').write_text(f"Task 1 completed at: {completion}\n")
```
```

# Test Phase 13 Team Coach Integration

## Objective
Validate that Phase 13 (Team Coach Reflection) is properly integrated and executes automatically at the end of workflows.

## Test Task
Create a simple documentation update that will go through all 13 phases to validate the Team Coach integration.

## Task Details

### Update README.md
Add a new section to README.md titled "Continuous Improvement with Team Coach" that documents:
1. How Team Coach is integrated as Phase 13
2. What insights it captures
3. How it helps improve development workflows

### Expected Workflow Phases

The workflow should execute all 13 phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Initial Setup ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Issue Creation ✅  
3. **Phase 3**: Branch Management ✅
4. **Phase 4**: Research and Planning ✅
5. **Phase 5**: Implementation ✅
6. **Phase 6**: Testing ✅
7. **Phase 7**: Documentation ✅
8. **Phase 8**: Pull Request ✅
9. **Phase 9**: Review (code-reviewer invocation) ✅
10. **Phase 10**: Review Response ✅
11. **Phase 11**: Settings Update ✅
12. **Phase 12**: Memory Compaction ✅
13. **Phase 13**: Team Coach Reflection ✅ (NEW - TO BE VALIDATED)

### Success Criteria

1. **Phase 13 Executes**: Team Coach is invoked automatically after Phase 12
2. **No Infinite Loops**: Team Coach completes without spawning new processes
3. **Insights Captured**: Team Coach insights are saved to Memory.md
4. **Graceful Failure**: If Team Coach fails, workflow still completes
5. **Performance**: Phase 13 adds no more than 30 seconds to workflow

### Validation Steps

1. Monitor the workflow execution logs
2. Verify Phase 13 is marked as "Team Coach Reflection" 
3. Check Memory.md for new Team Coach insights section
4. Confirm workflow completes successfully
5. Review any improvement recommendations generated

## Implementation Notes

This is a simple test task designed to validate the Phase 13 integration. The actual content change is minimal (adding a README section) to focus on testing the workflow phases rather than complex implementation.

## Expected Outcome

After successful execution:
- README.md has new "Continuous Improvement with Team Coach" section
- All 13 phases completed successfully
- Memory.md contains Team Coach insights from this session
- No process spawning or infinite loops occurred
- Workflow completed in reasonable time

# Task 5: System Design Review

## Objective
Conduct comprehensive system design review of Gadugi v0.3 implementation using the system-design-reviewer agent.

## Requirements
1. Validate all components against requirements checklist
2. Verify all components actually work (not stubs)
3. Test end-to-end workflows
4. Get final sign-off on implementation

## Review Checklist

### Component Verification
- [ ] Recipe Executor: Can generate code from recipes
- [ ] Event Router: Can spawn processes and route events
- [ ] Orchestrator: Delegates to WorkflowManager properly
- [ ] Neo4j: Running on port 7475 with schema

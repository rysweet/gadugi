# Memory System Integration Implementation

## Task: Complete Memory System Integration (#237)

### Objective
Complete the memory system by integrating all components to provide a unified context and memory management service for the Gadugi platform.

### Requirements

#### System Architecture
- **Location**: `.claude/services/memory-system/`
- **Integration Points**:
  - MCP service for persistence
  - Neo4j for graph-based memory relationships
  - Event Router for real-time notifications
  - GitHub API for issue synchronization

#### Core Features to Implement

1. **MCP-Neo4j Integration**
   - Connect MCP service with Neo4j graph database
   - Store memories as nodes with relationships
   - Enable graph-based memory traversal
   - Implement memory categorization (context, decision, pattern, achievement)

2. **Event Router Integration**
   - Subscribe to memory-related events
   - Publish memory updates via Event Router
   - Real-time notification of memory changes
   - Event types: memory.created, memory.updated, memory.pruned

3. **Memory.md Backward Compatibility**
   - Parse existing Memory.md format
   - Import legacy memories into new system
   - Maintain dual-write to Memory.md during transition
   - Provide migration utilities

4. **GitHub Issue Synchronization**
   - Sync todo items with GitHub issues
   - Bidirectional updates (Memory ↔ GitHub)
   - Label management (memory-sync, ai-assistant)
   - Automatic issue creation/closure

5. **Search and Retrieval Algorithms**
   - Context-aware memory retrieval
   - Relevance scoring based on current task
   - Pattern matching for similar situations
   - Performance target: <200ms retrieval

6. **Memory Management**
   - Automatic pruning of old/irrelevant memories
   - Memory consolidation and summarization
   - Pattern extraction from repeated tasks
   - Storage optimization

### Implementation Components

```python
# memory_system.py structure
class MemorySystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mcp_service = MCPService()
        self.neo4j_service = Neo4jGraphService()
        self.event_router = EventRouterService()
        self.github_client = GitHubClient()

    async def store_memory(self, memory: Memory) -> str
    async def retrieve_context(self, query: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[Memory]
    async def sync_with_github(self) -> SyncResult
    async def import_from_memory_md(self, filepath: Path) -> ImportResult
    async def prune_old_memories(self, days: int = 30) -> PruneResult
    async def extract_patterns(self) -> List[Pattern]
```

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all memory operations
- Integration tests with MCP and Neo4j
- Performance tests for retrieval (<200ms)
- GitHub sync validation tests
- Memory.md compatibility tests

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All components integrated and working
- ✅ Memory retrieval under 200ms
- ✅ GitHub synchronization functional
- ✅ Memory.md compatibility maintained
- ✅ Pattern extraction operational
- ✅ All tests passing with uv run pytest
- ✅ Code is pyright clean
- ✅ Code is ruff formatted

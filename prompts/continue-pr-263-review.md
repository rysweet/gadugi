# Continue PR #263 Workflow - Complete Phase 13

## Context
PR #263 has been created and phases 1-12 have been completed successfully. The workflow was interrupted before Phase 13 (Team Coach Reflection) could be executed.

## Current State
- PR #263: "fix: remove error suppression from critical code paths"
- Issue: #249
- Branch: fix/issue-249-remove-error-suppression
- Status: All CI checks passing, ready for merge
- Phases 1-12: ✅ Completed
- Phase 13: ⏳ Pending

## Task
Complete the remaining phase of the workflow for PR #263:

### Phase 13: Team Coach Reflection
Execute the Team Coach agent to:
1. Analyze the completed workflow (phases 1-12)
2. Extract lessons learned from this task
3. Identify patterns and improvements
4. Update Memory.md with insights
5. Generate recommendations for future workflows

## Requirements
1. Use the existing branch (fix/issue-249-remove-error-suppression)
2. No need to create a new worktree - work in the current repository
3. Complete Phase 13 Team Coach Reflection
4. Update the workflow state to mark all phases complete
5. Report completion status

## Expected Outcome
- Phase 13 executed successfully
- Memory.md updated with Team Coach insights

## Important Notes

# Add v0.1 Release Notes to README

## Task
Add release notes for milestone v0.1 to the top of the README.md file, right after the main title and badges section but before the main description.

## Requirements

1. **Research the v0.1 milestone**:
   - Use `gh api repos/rydcormier/gadugi/milestones` to get milestone information
   - Use `gh issue list --milestone "v0.1" --state all` to see what was included
   - Review recent commits and merged PRs associated with v0.1

2. **Create Release Notes Section**:
   - Add a new "## ðŸ“¦ Release Notes" section near the top of README.md
   - Write 1-2 concise paragraphs summarizing the v0.1 release
   - Focus on key features and improvements
   - Keep it brief and user-focused
   - Include the release date

3. **Content Guidelines**:
   - Highlight the most important capabilities added
   - Mention the orchestrator-based workflow system
   - Note the VS Code extension integration
   - Reference the 11-phase development workflow
   - Keep technical details minimal - focus on what users can do

4. **Placement**:
   - Place the release notes section after the badges but before the main project description
   - Ensure smooth flow with existing README content

## Example Format

## ðŸ“¦ Release Notes

### v0.1.0 - Initial Release (January 2025)

This inaugural release of Gadugi establishes the foundation for AI-assisted software development with a focus on systematic, quality-driven workflows. Key highlights include the orchestrator-based task management system, comprehensive VS Code integration, and the implementation of an 11-phase development workflow that ensures consistent, professional development practices from issue creation through code review.

The release introduces parallel task execution capabilities, automated git worktree management for isolated development environments, and seamless GitHub integration for issue tracking and pull request workflows. With built-in support for UV Python projects, pre-commit hooks, and automated testing gates, v0.1 provides a robust framework for maintaining code quality while accelerating development velocity.

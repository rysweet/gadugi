Execute these specific prompts in parallel:
- fix-final-pyright-errors.md
- complete-testing-suite.md
- final-integration-check.md

Configuration:
- Enable parallel execution mode
- Use worktree isolation for all tasks
- Monitor until completion
- Generate comprehensive execution report

Requirements:
1. Create isolated worktrees for each task
2. Use claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p for each WorkflowManager invocation
3. Execute all three tasks in parallel
4. Monitor progress and handle any failures
5. Achieve ZERO pyright errors in fix-final-pyright-errors.md task
6. Ensure complete test coverage in complete-testing-suite.md task
7. Validate full system integration in final-integration-check.md task

Context:
This is resuming work from an interrupted session. The orchestrator's parallel_executor.py has been updated to use the --dangerously-skip-permissions flag to prevent permission prompts during parallel execution.

Expected Outcome:
- All three tasks complete successfully
- ZERO pyright errors across the codebase
- Complete test suite with high coverage
- Validated system integration
- Clean parallel execution with no permission prompts

Priority: CRITICAL - These are the final tasks needed to complete the v0.3 implementation.

# Event System Changelog

## [v0.3.0] - 2025-08-29

### Added

#### Core Event System Implementation
- Implemented complete v0.3 event system specification
- Added core system events: `started`, `stopped`, `hasQuestion`, `needsApproval`, `cancel`
- All events now use dynamic `{agent_type}.{event_name}` format

#### Event Router Enhancements
- Added support for dynamic event types (removed restrictive enum validation)
- Fixed datetime serialization issues for event persistence
- Implemented pattern-based subscription routing with wildcard support
- Added priority-based event processing (CRITICAL → HIGH → NORMAL → LOW)

#### V03Agent Integration
- Enhanced `EventHandlerMixin` with core system event methods:
  - `emit_started()` - Agent task initiation
  - `emit_stopped()` - Agent task completion
  - `emit_has_question()` - Interactive user queries
  - `emit_needs_approval()` - User approval requests
  - `emit_cancel()` - Agent cancellation

#### Subscription Management
- Created `EventSubscriptionManager` with pattern matching
- Configured default subscriptions for all agents per v0.3 spec:
  - Orchestration: Routes user interactions, aggregates results
  - Gadugi: Tracks agent lifecycle
  - Team Coach: Triggers reflection, collects metrics
  - WorkflowManager: Handles task distribution
  - Memory Manager: Stores learnings and patterns
  - And more...

#### Configuration Files
- Created `event_config.yaml` with comprehensive event definitions
- Defined all agent subscriptions and routing rules
- Specified event priorities and handler mappings

#### Testing Infrastructure
- `test_v03_integration.py` - Tests V03Agent event emission
- `test_event_flow.py` - Demonstrates complete event flow between agents
- Verified all 10 core event types emit and route successfully

#### Documentation
- Created comprehensive `V03_EVENT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`
- Updated Event Router `README.md` with v0.3 event types and subscriptions
- Added subscription patterns and priority documentation
- Included troubleshooting and migration guides

### Changed

#### Event Router Models
- Changed `event_type` from enum to string field in `AgentEvent`
- Added `agent_type` field to support agent identification
- Enhanced event model with task_id, session_id, project_id fields

#### Event Storage
- Fixed JSON serialization for datetime objects
- Events now persist correctly to SQLite backend
- Added ISO format conversion for timestamps

### Fixed

- Event Router now accepts v0.3 core events (was rejecting them)
- DateTime serialization errors resolved
- Pattern matching for wildcard subscriptions working correctly
- Event routing to multiple subscribers functioning

### Technical Details

#### Files Modified
- `.claude/services/event-router/models.py` - Dynamic event type support
- `.claude/services/event-router/handlers.py` - Added subscription routing
- `.claude/services/event-router/subscriptions.py` - Created subscription manager
- `.claude/agents/base/event_handler_mixin.py` - Added core event methods
- `.claude/services/event-router/config.py` - Changed default port to 8001

#### Files Created
- `.claude/events/event_config.yaml` - Event configuration
- `.claude/events/V03_EVENT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation
- `.claude/services/event-router/test_v03_integration.py` - Integration tests
- `.claude/services/event-router/test_event_flow.py` - Event flow demo

### Testing Results

All event types successfully tested:
- ✅ Event emission from V03Agent
- ✅ Event reception by Event Router
- ✅ Pattern-based subscription routing
- ✅ Event persistence to SQLite
- ✅ Priority-based processing

### Known Issues

- Memory backend integration warnings (non-critical, fallback to SQLite works)
- Port 8000 conflict requires manual configuration to 8001

### Next Steps

1. Implement actual agent invocation when events are routed
2. Configure production agents to emit events
3. Set up GitHub webhook integration for external events
4. Add event replay capability for debugging
5. Implement event filtering and analytics dashboard

## Previous Context

This implementation continues from the initial Event Router setup and brings it into full compliance with the Gadugi v0.3 specification. The event system is now the central nervous system for all agent communication in the framework.

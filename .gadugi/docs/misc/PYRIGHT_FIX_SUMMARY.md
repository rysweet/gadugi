# Pyright Error Fix Summary

## Overview
This PR reduces pyright errors in the `.claude/` directory from 442 to 178 errors (60% reduction).

## Changes Made

### Import Fixes
- Removed unused `Set` imports from typing across 48+ files
- Fixed missing `Callable` import in test_stubs.py
- Fixed incomplete import statements (`from pathlib import` â†’ `from pathlib import Path`)
- Added missing imports for test utilities (Mock, patch, TestCase, etc.)

### Test File Improvements
- Created `MockPerformanceData` class for testing
- Fixed `PerformanceMetrics` usage in TeamCoach tests
- Fixed `AgentPerformance` parameter mismatches
- Corrected attribute access errors in test files

### Syntax Corrections
- Fixed unclosed parentheses in multiple files
- Corrected indentation issues in test files
- Fixed decorator usage issues
- Resolved statement separation problems

### Code Quality
- Replaced unused loop variables with `_`
- Removed redundant imports
- Fixed possibly unbound variables
- Cleaned up duplicate class declarations

## Files Modified
- 60 files updated across:
  - `.claude/agents/` - Agent implementations and tests
  - `.claude/services/` - Service layer components
  - `.claude/framework/` - Base framework classes
  - `.claude/orchestrator/` - Orchestrator components
  - `.claude/shared/` - Shared utilities

## Remaining Work
178 errors remain, primarily in:
- Test files with complex mocking scenarios
- Files with dynamic imports
- Legacy code that needs refactoring

## Testing
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No regression in functionality
- Pre-commit hooks now pass for modified files

## Next Steps
1. Address remaining 178 errors in follow-up PRs
2. Add type stubs for external dependencies
3. Update pyrightconfig.json for better type checking

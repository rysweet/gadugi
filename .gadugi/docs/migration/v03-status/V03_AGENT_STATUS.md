# V0.3 Agent Integration Status

## Current Situation

The agents in `.claude/agents/` are **NOT fully integrated** with v0.3 services. Here's what I found:

### What Exists

1. **Agent Markdown Files** (in `.claude/agents/`):
   - WorkflowManager.md
   - OrchestratorAgent.md
   - TaskResearchAgent.md
   - MemoryManager.md
   - EventRouterManager.md
   - etc.

2. **Some Python Implementations** (in `.claude/agents/`):
   - `orchestrator/orchestrator.py` - Has PLACEHOLDER memory system classes
   - `enhanced_workflow_manager.py` - References shared modules but no memory integration

3. **Memory Integration Module** (created for v0.3):
   - `.claude/shared/memory_integration.py` - Full AgentMemoryInterface implementation
   - Ready to use but NOT integrated into existing agents

### What's Missing

❌ **No agents actually use the v0.3 memory system**
- The orchestrator.py has placeholder classes instead of real memory integration
- Agent markdown files reference old patterns, not v0.3 services

❌ **No agents use the event router**
- Event router exists (`.claude/services/event-router/`)
- But agents don't publish/subscribe to events

❌ **Agents aren't memory-aware**
- They can't store/recall memories
- They don't use whiteboards for collaboration
- They don't build knowledge graphs

## The Reality

**The agents are v0.2 agents living in the v0.3 codebase.**

They were copied over but not upgraded to use:
- Neo4j/SQLite memory backend
- MCP service API
- Event router
- Knowledge graphs
- Task whiteboards

## What Needs to Happen

To make agents truly v0.3-enabled:

### 1. Update Agent Base Class
```python
# Instead of current placeholder
from .claude.shared.memory_integration import AgentMemoryInterface

class V03Agent:
    def __init__(self, agent_id: str):
        self.memory = AgentMemoryInterface(agent_id)

    async def execute(self, task):
        # Store task in memory
        await self.memory.remember_short_term(f"Starting: {task}")

        # Do work...

        # Store results
        await self.memory.remember_long_term(f"Completed: {result}")
```

### 2. Update Each Agent

For each agent in `.claude/agents/`:

```python
# OLD (current)
class WorkflowManager:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # No memory

# NEW (v0.3)
class WorkflowManagerV03:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = AgentMemoryInterface("workflow_manager")
        self.event_router = EventRouter()

    async def run_workflow(self, prompt):
        # Use memory
        await self.memory.start_task(prompt.task_id)

        # Publish events
        await self.event_router.publish("workflow.started", {...})

        # Collaborate via whiteboard
        await self.memory.write_to_whiteboard("status", "in_progress")
```

### 3. Enable Agent Collaboration

Agents should:
- Share whiteboards for tasks
- Build collective knowledge graphs
- Learn from each other's procedures

## Quick Fix to Use v0.3 Now

To use v0.3 capabilities immediately without updating all agents:

```python
# Create a v0.3 wrapper for any agent
class V03Wrapper:
    def __init__(self, agent_class, agent_id):
        self.agent = agent_class()
        self.memory = AgentMemoryInterface(agent_id)

    async def execute(self, task):
        # Add memory to any agent
        await self.memory.remember_short_term(f"Task: {task}")
        result = await self.agent.execute(task)
        await self.memory.remember_long_term(f"Result: {result}")
        return result

# Use it
workflow_mgr = V03Wrapper(WorkflowManager, "workflow_v03")
await workflow_mgr.execute("Build feature X")
```

## Summary

**Current agents**: v0.2 style (no memory, no events)
**v0.3 infrastructure**: Ready (memory system, event router)
**Integration**: Missing - agents need updates to use v0.3 services

To truly use v0.3, we need to either:
1. Update existing agents to use memory/events
2. Create new v0.3-native agents
3. Use wrapper pattern to add v0.3 capabilities

The infrastructure is there, but the agents aren't plugged into it yet!

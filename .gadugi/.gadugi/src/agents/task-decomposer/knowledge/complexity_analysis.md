# Complexity Analysis for Task Decomposition


## üö® CRITICAL: Workflow Enforcement

**This agent MUST be invoked through the orchestrator for ANY code changes.**

### Workflow Requirements:
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Use orchestrator for file modifications
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Follow 11-phase workflow for code changes
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Direct file editing or creation
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Bypassing quality gates

### When Orchestrator is REQUIRED:
- Any file modifications (.py, .js, .json, .md, etc.)
- Creating or deleting files/directories
- Installing or updating dependencies
- Configuration changes
- Bug fixes and feature implementations
- Code refactoring or optimization

### When Direct Execution is OK:
- Reading and analyzing existing files
- Answering questions about code
- Generating reports (without file output)
- Code reviews and analysis

### Compliance Check:
Before executing any task, validate with:
```bash
python .claude/workflow-enforcement/validate-workflow.py --task "your task description"
```

### Emergency Override:
Only for critical production issues:
- Must include explicit justification
- Automatically logged for review
- Subject to retrospective approval

**üîí REMEMBER: This workflow protects code quality and ensures proper testing!**

## Overview

# Orchestrator Execution for Gadugi v0.3 Implementation

## Tasks to Execute

Execute the following prompts for Gadugi v0.3 implementation:

1. **setup-neo4j-gadugi.md** - Initialize and test Neo4j database integration
2. **implement-mcp-service.md** - Fix pyright errors and implement MCP service
3. **implement-agent-framework.md** - Fix errors and implement agent framework
4. **fix-remaining-pyright-errors.md** - Fix all remaining pyright errors

## Execution Strategy

### Parallel Execution Groups

**Group 1 (Can run in parallel):**
- setup-neo4j-gadugi.md (independent database setup)
- implement-agent-framework.md (independent framework work)

**Group 2 (Sequential after Group 1):**
- implement-mcp-service.md (depends on Neo4j being ready)
- fix-remaining-pyright-errors.md (should run last to catch all issues)

## Important Context

- This is a UV Python project - all Python commands must use `uv run` prefix
- Neo4j runs on non-standard port 7475
- Each task must go through complete 11-phase WorkflowManager workflow
- Proper issue creation, branch management, testing, and PR creation required

## Success Criteria

- All Neo4j integration working on port 7475
- MCP service functional with zero pyright errors
- Agent framework implemented with Event Router integration
- Zero pyright errors across entire codebase
- All tests passing with `uv run pytest`

# README Humility Update - Remove Performance Claims

## Overview
Update README.md to remove performance claims and adopt a more humble, accurate tone about the project's capabilities. This aligns with best practices of under-promising and over-delivering.

## Objectives
1. Remove all unsubstantiated performance claims
2. Remove references to "production ready" or "enterprise grade"
3. Remove UV performance comparison section
4. Maintain professional tone while being modest
5. Focus on actual features rather than claims

## Specific Changes Required

### Remove Performance Claims
- Remove any "3-5x faster" or similar performance multipliers
- Remove "production ready" claims
- Remove "enterprise grade" references
- Remove comparative performance statements

### Sections to Modify or Remove
1. **UV Performance Section**: Remove entirely if it contains unverified claims
2. **Performance Monitoring References**: Update to be factual rather than promotional
3. **Introduction**: Ensure it focuses on what the system does, not performance claims

### Tone Guidelines
- **Instead of**: "Achieves 3-5x performance improvements"
- **Use**: "Designed to improve development efficiency"

- **Instead of**: "Production-ready enterprise system"
- **Use**: "Multi-agent development framework"

- **Instead of**: "Blazing fast performance with UV"
- **Use**: "Uses UV for Python dependency management"

## Search Patterns
Look for and review:
- "performance"
- "faster"
- "speed"
- "enterprise"
- "production"
- "blazing"
- "efficient"
- "optimiz"
- "3-5x"
- "improvement"

## Acceptable Claims
Keep only verifiable, factual statements:
- Number of agents in the system
- Number of workflow phases
- Actual features implemented
- Technologies used
- Architecture descriptions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] No unverified performance claims remain
- [ ] No "production ready" or "enterprise" claims
- [ ] Tone is professional but humble
- [ ] Focus is on features and capabilities
- [ ] README remains informative and useful

## Notes
- This is about being honest and setting appropriate expectations
- Better to under-promise and over-deliver
- Focus on what the system actually does well
- Let the code quality speak for itself

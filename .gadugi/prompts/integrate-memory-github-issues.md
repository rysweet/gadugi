# Integrate Memory.md with GitHub Issues

## Title and Overview

**Memory.md GitHub Issues Integration**

This prompt implements bidirectional integration between the Memory.md file and GitHub issues, automatically creating issues from Memory.md tasks and keeping them synchronized. This enhances project visibility and management while maintaining the existing Memory.md workflow.

**Context**: The current Memory.md system provides excellent persistence for AI assistant context but lacks integration with project management tools. GitHub issues provide visibility, tracking, and collaboration features that complement the Memory.md approach.

## Problem Statement

The current Memory.md system has limitations for project management and collaboration:

1. **Visibility Gap**: Tasks in Memory.md are invisible to project stakeholders
2. **No Collaboration**: Other team members cannot contribute to or track Memory.md tasks
3. **Project Management**: No integration with standard project management workflows
4. **Task Tracking**: Difficult to track task history and completion over time
5. **Reporting**: No easy way to generate reports on task completion and progress

**Current Limitation**: Memory.md serves as an excellent AI assistant brain but doesn't integrate with broader project management and collaboration workflows.

## Feature Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Automatic Issue Creation**: Convert Memory.md todo items to GitHub issues
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Update Memory.md when issues change and vice versa
- **Smart Mapping**: Link Memory.md tasks to appropriate GitHub issues
- **Status Synchronization**: Keep completion status in sync between systems
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle conflicts when both systems are updated

### Technical Requirements
- **GitHub API Integration**: Use GitHub CLI and API for issue management
- **Memory.md Parsing**: Parse and modify Memory.md format programmatically
- **Real-time Sync**: Periodic synchronization without manual intervention
- **Configuration**: Configurable sync policies and mapping rules
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and conflicts

### Integration Requirements
- **Preserve Memory.md**: Maintain existing Memory.md functionality and format
- **GitHub Compatibility**: Follow GitHub issue conventions and best practices
- **Agent Integration**: Work seamlessly with existing agent workflows
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on Memory.md read/write operations

### Proposed Integration Architecture
```
Memory.md ←→ Sync Engine ←→ GitHub Issues
    ↓             ↓              ↓
Memory Parser  Conflict     Issue Manager
               Resolution
```

### Synchronization Strategy
1. **Parse Memory.md**: Extract tasks and their status
2. **Map to Issues**: Create or find corresponding GitHub issues
3. **Sync Status**: Update both systems based on changes
4. **Resolve Conflicts**: Handle simultaneous updates intelligently
5. **Update Memory.md**: Reflect any changes back to Memory.md

### Integration Points
- **Memory.md Updates**: Trigger sync when Memory.md is modified
- **GitHub Webhooks**: Receive notifications when issues change
- **Agent Workflows**: Integrate with existing Memory.md update patterns
- **CLI Integration**: Use existing `gh` CLI for issue operations

## Implementation Plan

## Testing Requirements

### Synchronization Testing
- **Create Tasks**: Test Memory.md task → GitHub issue creation
- **Update Tasks**: Test status changes in both directions
- **Delete Tasks**: Test task removal and archival
- **Conflict Resolution**: Test simultaneous updates
- **Bulk Operations**: Test synchronization of many tasks

### Integration Testing
- **Memory.md Compatibility**: Verify existing Memory.md functionality preserved
- **Agent Integration**: Test with existing agent Memory.md update patterns
- **GitHub API**: Test all GitHub issue operations
- **Error Scenarios**: Test API failures and network issues
- **Performance**: Test sync overhead and latency

### Edge Cases
- **Malformed Memory.md**: Handle parsing errors gracefully
- **GitHub API Limits**: Handle rate limiting and quotas
- **Network Failures**: Graceful degradation during outages
- **Large Task Lists**: Performance with hundreds of tasks
- **Special Characters**: Handle Unicode and special formatting

## Success Criteria

### Synchronization Accuracy
- **100% Task Mapping**: All Memory.md tasks correctly mapped to GitHub issues
- **Bi-directional Sync**: Changes in either system reflected in the other within 5 minutes
- **Conflict Resolution**: <1% data loss during conflict resolution
- **Status Accuracy**: Task completion status always consistent between systems

### Performance Requirements
- **Fast Sync**: Complete synchronization in <30 seconds for typical task lists
- **Low Overhead**: <1 second added to Memory.md read/write operations
- **API Efficiency**: Minimize GitHub API calls through intelligent batching
- **Reliable Operation**: 99% synchronization success rate

### Integration Quality

## Memory.md Format Considerations

### Task Extraction Patterns
```markdown
# Detect different task formats
- [ ] Pending task
- ✅ Completed task
- [x] Alternative completed format
- [ ] Task with **priority** or *emphasis*
- [ ] Task with issue reference #123
```

### Metadata Preservation
- **Task IDs**: Add hidden metadata to link tasks to issues
- **Sync Status**: Track last sync timestamp
- **Conflict Markers**: Mark conflicts for manual resolution
- **Original Format**: Preserve original formatting and structure

### Example Enhanced Format
```markdown
## Current Goals
- [ ] Implement feature X <!-- issue:123 sync:2024-01-01T12:00:00Z -->
- ✅ Fix bug Y <!-- issue:124 completed:2024-01-01T11:00:00Z -->

<!-- memory-github-sync metadata
last_sync: 2024-01-01T12:00:00Z
sync_policy: auto
conflict_resolution: manual
-->
```

## GitHub Issues Integration

### Issue Creation Policy
- **One-to-One Mapping**: Each Memory.md task becomes one GitHub issue
- **Automatic Labels**: Add labels like "memory-sync", "ai-assistant"
- **Template Usage**: Use consistent issue templates for Memory.md tasks
- **Attribution**: Include AI assistant attribution in issue descriptions

### Issue Management
- **Title Generation**: Create descriptive titles from Memory.md task text
- **Description Enhancement**: Add context and implementation details
- **Label Management**: Automatically apply appropriate labels
- **Milestone Assignment**: Map to appropriate milestones if configured

### Sync Behavior
```yaml
# sync-config.yaml
sync_policy:
  direction: bidirectional  # memory-to-github, github-to-memory, bidirectional
  frequency: 5m             # How often to check for changes
  batch_size: 10            # Max issues to process at once

conflict_resolution:
  strategy: manual          # auto, manual, memory-wins, github-wins
  notification: comment     # comment, label, none

issue_creation:
  auto_create: true
  template: "memory-task"
  labels: ["memory-sync", "ai-assistant"]
  assignee: auto            # auto, none, specific-user
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **GitHub API Failures**: Rate limits, network issues, authentication
2. **Memory.md Corruption**: File parsing errors, invalid format
3. **Sync Conflicts**: Simultaneous updates to both systems
4. **Missing Issues**: Referenced GitHub issues that no longer exist
5. **Permission Issues**: Insufficient GitHub repository permissions

### Recovery Strategies
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for temporary failures
- **Conflict Queues**: Queue conflicts for manual resolution
- **Backup Creation**: Backup Memory.md before modifications
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to undo sync operations
- **Manual Override**: Allow manual sync control when automatic fails

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Local Processing**: Minimize data sent to external services
- **Credential Security**: Secure storage of GitHub tokens
- **Content Filtering**: Option to exclude sensitive tasks from sync
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all sync operations

### Access Control
- **Repository Permissions**: Verify GitHub repository access before sync
- **User Authentication**: Secure GitHub authentication flow
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect GitHub API rate limits
- **Error Disclosure**: Avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages

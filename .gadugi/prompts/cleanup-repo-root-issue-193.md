# Cleanup Repository Root for v0.1 Milestone

## Issue Reference
- Issue #193: Cleanup unnecessary files in repository root for v0.1 milestone

## Overview
The repository root contains various old checklists and unnecessary files that should be cleaned up as part of the v0.1 milestone preparation. This task requires identifying and removing outdated files while preserving essential project files.

## Objectives
1. Identify and remove old checklist files in the repository root
2. Remove outdated or unnecessary documentation files
3. Clean up any temporary or test files that shouldn't be in version control
4. Ensure the repository root is clean and professional for the v0.1 release

## Technical Requirements

### Files to Remove (Examples)
- Old checklist files (any file with "checklist" in the name)
- Temporary files (*.tmp, *.bak, *.old)
- Build artifacts that shouldn't be committed
- Outdated documentation that's been superseded
- Test files that belong in test directories
- Any orphaned or duplicate files

### Files to Preserve (Critical)
- README.md
- LICENSE
- pyproject.toml
- uv.lock
- .gitignore
- .pre-commit-config.yaml
- Dockerfile (if exists)
- CLAUDE.md
- Any active configuration files

## Implementation Steps
1. List all files in the repository root
2. Categorize files as "keep" or "remove"
3. Document the files being removed for the PR description
4. Remove the identified unnecessary files
5. Verify the project still builds and tests pass
6. Update any documentation if needed
7. Create PR with detailed list of removed files

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Repository root contains only essential files
- [ ] All old checklists are removed
- [ ] No temporary or test files remain in root
- [ ] Project builds successfully after cleanup
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Clean, organized structure ready for v0.1

## Testing Requirements
After removing files, verify:
1. `uv sync --all-extras` completes successfully
2. `uv run pytest tests/` passes
3. `uv run ruff check .` passes
4. Pre-commit hooks pass
5. No import errors or missing dependencies

## Notes
- Be conservative - when in doubt, preserve the file
- Document each removed file in the PR for review
- This is part of v0.1 milestone preparation
- Ensure no essential functionality is broken

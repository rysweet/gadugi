# v0.1 Milestone Tasks

## Task 1: Code Review Response for PR #207
**Issue**: #206
**PR**: #207
**Priority**: HIGH - Blocking v0.1

The code review identified critical issues that must be fixed:
1. **Incomplete file movement** - Files exist in BOTH old and new locations
2. **Reference verification needed** - Ensure all paths are updated
3. **Missing migration docs** - Need to document the reorganization

### Required Actions:
- Remove duplicate files from root (they should only exist in new locations)
- Verify all references in CLAUDE.md, README.md, and other files
- Add migration documentation
- Run full test suite to confirm functionality

## Task 2: README Humility Update
**Issue**: #208
**Priority**: MEDIUM

Remove unsubstantiated claims from README.md:
- Remove "3-5x faster" performance claims
- Remove "production ready" / "enterprise grade" language
- Remove "blazing fast" marketing speak
- Apply humble, factual tone
- Focus on actual features, not claims

## Task 3: Comprehensive Documentation
**Issue**: #128
**Priority**: MEDIUM

Create the comprehensive documentation structure:

### Required Files:
- `docs/getting-started.md` - Installation and setup guide
- `docs/architecture.md` - System design and components
- `docs/agents/README.md` - Complete agent catalog
- `docs/workflows.md` - Common workflow patterns
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `docs/api-reference.md` - CLI and agent interfaces
- `docs/contributing.md` - Contribution guidelines

### README.md Updates:
- Clear project overview
- Quick start section
- Link to detailed docs
- Agent catalog summary
- Example workflows

## Execution Notes:
- Task 1 is highest priority - fixes PR #207 for v0.1
- Tasks 2 and 3 can potentially run in parallel
- All tasks require full 11-phase workflow
- Ensure comprehensive testing after changes

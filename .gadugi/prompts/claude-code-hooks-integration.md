# Claude-Code Hooks Integration System Implementation

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive event-driven architecture for the Gadugi multi-agent system through Claude-Code hooks integration. This system will provide automated security wrapping, intelligent coordination, and persistent state management across all agent operations.

## Problem Statement

The Gadugi multi-agent system currently lacks:
1. **Security Integration**: No automatic XPIA defense for web-based operations
2. **Event-Driven Coordination**: Manual agent coordination instead of automatic triggers
3. **State Persistence**: Limited session state preservation across interruptions
4. **Hook Management**: No centralized hook management system
5. **Container Integration**: Hooks not integrated with the Container Execution Environment

This creates security vulnerabilities, coordination inefficiencies, and poor user experience during long-running workflows.

## Technical Analysis

### Required Hook Types

#### 1. PreTool Hooks
- **WebFetch/WebSearch**: Inject XPIA agent wrapping before web operations
- **Bash Commands**: Container execution routing for untrusted operations
- **File Operations**: Security policy enforcement

#### 2. PostTool Hooks
- **WebFetch/WebSearch**: Pass data through XPIA agent for analysis
- **Bash Commands**: Result validation and cleanup
- **State Updates**: Automatic state persistence

#### 3. Event Hooks
- **SubagentStop**: Invoke TeamCoach for performance analysis
- **Stop**: Invoke TeamCoach and SpecMaintainer
- **SessionStart**: Agent team rehydration and state recovery
- **SessionStop**: Memory Manager invocation and state persistence

### Integration Points

#### Enhanced Separation Shared Modules
- **Error Handling**: Circuit breakers and retry logic for hook execution
- **State Management**: Hook state persistence and recovery
- **GitHub Operations**: Automated issue/PR updates based on hook events
- **Task Tracking**: Hook execution metrics and performance monitoring

#### Container Execution Environment
- **Security Policies**: Hook-triggered security policy selection
- **Resource Management**: Hook-based resource allocation and cleanup
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive hook execution audit trails

#### Agent Ecosystem Integration
- **XPIA Defense Agent**: Automatic web security wrapping
- **TeamCoach Agent**: Performance monitoring and coordination
- **Memory Manager**: State persistence and cleanup

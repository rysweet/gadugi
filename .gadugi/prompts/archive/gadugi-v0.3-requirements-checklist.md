## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Recipe Executor
- [ ] Create Recipe Executor Agent that can read recipes and implement them
- [ ] Test with simple component first
- [ ] Validate it actually creates working code

### Phase 2: Foundation Services (No Dependencies)
- [ ] Event System with Protobuf
  - [ ] Define actual protobuf files
  - [ ] Generate Python bindings
  - [ ] Implement event router that can start processes
  - [ ] Test with real agent subprocess
- [ ] Neo4j Setup
  - [ ] Create Gadugi-specific container
  - [ ] Define schema
  - [ ] Test connection

### Phase 3: Core Services (Depend on Foundation)
- [ ] MCP Service
  - [ ] Implement REST API
  - [ ] Connect to Neo4j
  - [ ] Test CRUD operations
- [ ] Agent Framework
  - [ ] BaseAgent with event handling
  - [ ] YAML frontmatter parsing
  - [ ] Tool registry
  - [ ] Test with example agent

### Phase 4: Agents (Depend on Framework)
- [ ] Task Decomposer
  - [ ] Implement decomposition logic
  - [ ] Test with real tasks
- [ ] Orchestrator
  - [ ] Implement parallel execution
  - [ ] Test parallelization
- [ ] Team Coach
  - [ ] Session analysis
  - [ ] GitHub issue creation
  - [ ] Test with real sessions

### Phase 5: Integration
- [ ] End-to-end test of event flow
- [ ] Test agent subprocess spawning
- [ ] Test memory persistence
- [ ] Test parallel execution

### Phase 6: Reviews
- [ ] Design review for each component
- [ ] Code review for each component
- [ ] System design review of integrated system
- [ ] Final sign-off from system design review agent

# Setup Container Execution Environment

## Title and Overview

**Container Execution Environment Implementation**

This prompt implements a secure container-based execution environment for the Gadugi multi-agent system. The system will provide isolated execution of untrusted code and scripts, replacing the current shell-based execution with containerized security boundaries.

**Context**: The current agent-manager system executes shell scripts directly, creating potential security risks. Moving to containerized execution provides process isolation, resource limits, and security boundaries for safer operation.

## Problem Statement

The current execution model in Gadugi has several security and operational limitations:

1. **Direct Shell Execution**: Scripts run directly on the host system without isolation
2. **Resource Unlimited**: No limits on CPU, memory, or disk usage
3. **Security Boundaries**: No protection against malicious or runaway scripts
4. **System Exposure**: Scripts have access to host filesystem and network
5. **Cleanup Challenges**: Failed executions can leave artifacts on the host system

**Current Risk**: Direct shell execution exposes the host system to potential security breaches, resource exhaustion, and system instability from untrusted code execution.

## Feature Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Process Isolation**: Execute code in completely isolated containers
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable CPU, memory, disk, and network limits
- **Security Boundaries**: Prevent container escape and host system access
- **Multiple Runtimes**: Support for different language environments (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- **File System Isolation**: Isolated filesystem with controlled host access
- **Network Isolation**: Controlled network access with optional internet connectivity

### Technical Requirements
- **Container Runtime**: Docker or containerd-based execution
- **Performance**: <5 second container startup for common environments
- **Resource Management**: Configurable resource policies per execution type
- **Image Management**: Efficient container image caching and updates
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing agent-manager system

### Security Requirements
- **Container Security**: Hardened container images with minimal attack surface
- **Host Protection**: No container access to sensitive host resources
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Network Security**: Controlled network access with firewall rules
- **Audit Logging**: Complete execution audit trail

## Technical Analysis

### Current Execution Model
```bash
# Current: Direct shell execution
bash /path/to/script.sh
```

### Proposed Container Model
```bash
# New: Containerized execution
docker run --rm \
  --memory=512m \
  --cpus=1.0 \
  --network=none \
  --read-only \
  --tmpfs /tmp \
  -v /execution/input:/input:ro \
  -v /execution/output:/output:rw \
  gadugi/runtime:python \
  python /input/script.py
```

### Architecture Components
1. **Container Runtime**: Docker/containerd for container execution
2. **Image Registry**: Local registry for runtime images

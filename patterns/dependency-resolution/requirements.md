# Dependency Resolution Pattern Requirements

## Purpose
Implement topological sorting and validation for resolving dependencies between components, ensuring proper build order and preventing circular dependencies.

## Functional Requirements

- MUST detect circular dependencies before processing
- MUST resolve dependencies using topological sort algorithm
- MUST validate all dependencies exist before resolution
- MUST support both internal and external dependencies
- MUST maintain dependency graph for analysis
- MUST provide clear error messages for dependency issues
- MUST support version constraints for dependencies
- MUST cache resolved dependency graphs for performance

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Dependency resolution MUST complete in O(n + m) time (n=nodes, m=edges)
- MUST handle dependency graphs with up to 1000 components
- MUST provide detailed logging of resolution process
- MUST support parallel resolution of independent branches
- MUST maintain resolution state for recovery from failures

## Success Criteria

- All dependencies resolved in correct order
- Circular dependencies detected and reported
- Missing dependencies identified before build
- Resolution process completes successfully
- Performance meets O(n + m) complexity requirement

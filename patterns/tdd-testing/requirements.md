# TDD Testing Pattern Requirements

## Purpose
Enforce Test-Driven Development methodology where tests are written before implementation to drive design and ensure correctness.

## Functional Requirements

- Tests MUST be generated before implementation code
- Tests MUST initially fail (red phase)
- Implementation MUST be minimal to make tests pass (green phase)
- Tests MUST cover all MUST requirements from the recipe
- Tests MUST include edge cases and error conditions
- Tests MUST use pytest framework
- Tests MUST have descriptive names explaining what they test
- Tests MUST be independent and not rely on execution order

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Test execution MUST complete in under 30 seconds for unit tests
- Tests MUST achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- Tests MUST use fixtures for common setup
- Tests MUST use parameterization for testing multiple scenarios
- Tests MUST follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Success Criteria

- All tests pass after implementation
- Coverage report shows > 80% coverage
- No test interdependencies exist
- Tests can run in any order
- Tests provide clear failure messages

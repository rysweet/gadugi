# State Management Pattern Requirements

## Purpose
Provide robust state management for multi-phase operations with progress tracking, recovery capabilities, and transition validation.

## Functional Requirements

- MUST track state for each component independently
- MUST support atomic state transitions
- MUST persist state for recovery from failures
- MUST validate state transitions against allowed paths
- MUST provide rollback capabilities for failed operations
- MUST emit events on state changes
- MUST support concurrent state updates with proper locking
- MUST maintain audit log of all state changes

## Non-Functional Requirements

- State transitions MUST be atomic and consistent
- State persistence MUST survive process restarts
- State queries MUST complete in under 10ms
- MUST support at least 10,000 concurrent state objects
- State storage MUST be cleanable of old/completed states

## Success Criteria

- All state transitions are validated and atomic
- Failed operations can be resumed from last state
- State history is complete and auditable
- No state corruption under concurrent access
- Recovery from failure maintains consistency

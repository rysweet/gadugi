# Code Generation Pattern Requirements

## Purpose
Generate real, working code implementations using AI models (specifically Claude) with no stubs, no placeholders, and comprehensive error handling.

## Functional Requirements

- MUST use Claude AI for code generation (no fallback generators)
- MUST generate complete, working implementations
- MUST NEVER generate stub code with NotImplementedError
- MUST NEVER generate empty pass statements as placeholders
- MUST validate generated code meets requirements
- MUST handle AI model failures appropriately
- MUST format prompts for optimal AI understanding
- MUST verify generated code syntax is valid

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Code generation MUST complete within 60 seconds per component
- MUST handle AI model timeouts gracefully
- MUST log all generation attempts and outcomes
- Generated code MUST pass linting and type checking
- MUST NOT generate code without AI model availability

## Success Criteria

- All generated code is complete and functional
- No stub implementations in generated code
- AI model failures handled with clear errors
- Generated code passes all quality checks
- Code meets all specified requirements

# Validation Framework Pattern Requirements

## Purpose
Implement comprehensive validation for all inputs, configurations, and data structures to ensure correctness and prevent security issues.

## Functional Requirements

- MUST validate all external inputs before processing
- MUST check data types and ranges for all fields
- MUST validate file paths and prevent directory traversal
- MUST validate JSON schema compliance
- MUST validate markdown structure and content
- MUST provide detailed validation error messages
- MUST support custom validation rules
- MUST validate dependencies and versions

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Validation MUST complete within 100ms for typical inputs
- MUST handle validation of files up to 10MB
- MUST prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- MUST log all validation failures for security audit
- MUST support extensible validation rules

## Success Criteria

- All invalid inputs rejected with clear errors
- No security vulnerabilities from unvalidated input
- Validation performance within requirements
- Custom validation rules work correctly
- Validation errors are actionable and specific

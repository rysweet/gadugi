Execute these specific prompts for Gadugi v0.3 implementation:
- setup-neo4j-gadugi.md
- implement-mcp-service.md
- implement-agent-framework.md
- fix-remaining-pyright-errors.md

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. This is a UV Python project - ALL Python commands must use 'uv run' prefix
2. Neo4j runs on port 7475 (non-standard)
3. Use parallel execution where possible:
   - Group 1 (parallel): setup-neo4j-gadugi.md, implement-agent-framework.md
   - Group 2 (sequential): implement-mcp-service.md (needs Neo4j), fix-remaining-pyright-errors.md (run last)
4. Each task MUST follow complete 11-phase WorkflowManager workflow
5. Ensure proper worktree isolation for all tasks

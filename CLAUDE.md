## CRITICAL: Workflow Execution Pattern

⚠️ **MANDATORY ORCHESTRATOR USAGE** ⚠️

**ALL requests that will result in changes to version-controlled files MUST use the orchestrator agent.**

This ensures:
- Proper worktree isolation for all changes
- Consistent branch management
- Complete workflow tracking
- Parallel execution when possible
- Professional development practices

**For ANY task that modifies code, configuration, or documentation files:**

1. **NEVER manually edit files directly**
2. **ALWAYS use the orchestrator agent as the entry point**:

   ```
   /agent:orchestrator-agent

   Execute the following task:
   - [description of changes needed]
   ```

3. **The Orchestrator will automatically**:
   - Invoke the worktree-manager to create isolated environments
   - Delegate to appropriate sub-agents (WorkflowManager, etc.)
   - Coordinate parallel execution when multiple tasks exist
   - Ensure proper branch creation and PR workflow

4. **Agent Hierarchy**:
   - **OrchestratorAgent**: REQUIRED entry point for ALL code changes
   - **WorktreeManager**: Automatically invoked by orchestrator for isolation
   - **WorkflowManager**: Handles individual workflow execution (MANDATORY for all tasks)
   - **Code-Reviewer**: Executes Phase 9 reviews

**⚠️ GOVERNANCE ENFORCEMENT**: The OrchestratorAgent MUST ALWAYS delegate ALL task execution to WorkflowManager instances. Direct execution is PROHIBITED to ensure complete workflow phases are followed (Issue #148).

5. **Automated Workflow Handling**:
   - Issue creation
   - Worktree and branch management
   - Implementation tracking
   - PR creation
   - Code review invocation (Phase 9)
   - State management

6. **Mandatory 11-Phase Workflow** (ALL tasks MUST follow):
   - Phase 1: Initial Setup
   - Phase 2: Issue Creation
   - Phase 3: Branch Management
   - Phase 4: Research and Planning
   - Phase 5: Implementation
   - Phase 6: Testing
   - Phase 7: Documentation
   - Phase 8: Pull Request
   - Phase 9: Review (code-reviewer invocation)
   - Phase 10: Review Response
   - Phase 11: Settings Update

**Only execute manual steps for**:
- Read-only operations (searching, viewing files)
- Answering questions about the codebase
- Running tests or builds without changes
- Direct user requests for specific read-only actions

**Before ANY task, ask yourself**:
- Will this change version-controlled files? → MUST use OrchestratorAgent
- Multiple related tasks? → Use OrchestratorAgent
- Single task with code changes? → Use OrchestratorAgent
- Read-only investigation? → Can execute manually

**Workflow Validation Requirements**:
- Orchestrator MUST delegate ALL tasks to WorkflowManager
- ALL 11 workflow phases MUST be executed for every task
- NO direct execution bypassing workflow phases
- State tracking MUST be maintained throughout all phases
- Quality gates MUST be validated at each phase transition

**Enforcement Examples**:
- ✅ **Compliant**: `/agent:orchestrator-agent` → delegates to `/agent:workflow-manager` for each task
- ❌ **Violation**: Using `claude -p prompt.md` directly bypasses workflow phases
- ❌ **Violation**: Direct shell script execution without issue creation and PR workflow
- ✅ **Validation**: Pre-execution checks verify WorkflowManager delegation for all tasks
- ⚠️ **Detection**: Governance violations logged with specific error types and task IDs

### Emergency Procedures (Critical Production Issues)

⚠️ **EMERGENCY HOTFIX EXCEPTION** ⚠️

For **CRITICAL PRODUCTION ISSUES** requiring immediate fixes (security vulnerabilities, system downtime, data corruption), you may bypass the orchestrator requirement:

**Emergency Criteria** (ALL must be true):
- Production system is down or compromised
- Issue poses immediate security risk or data loss
- Fix is simple and well-understood (< 10 lines of code)
- No time for full workflow due to business impact

**Emergency Procedure**:
1. **Document the emergency**: Create issue with `emergency` label
2. **Work directly on main branch** (exception to normal branching)
3. **Make minimal, focused changes only**
4. **Commit with clear emergency attribution**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "EMERGENCY: fix critical [issue description]

   Emergency hotfix bypassing normal orchestrator workflow
   due to production impact. Full workflow to follow.

   Fixes: [issue-number]"
   ```
5. **Immediately create follow-up issue** for proper workflow implementation
6. **Return to orchestrator requirement** for all subsequent changes

**Post-Emergency Actions**:
- Conduct immediate post-mortem
- Implement proper tests via orchestrator workflow
- Update documentation to prevent recurrence
- Review emergency decision in next team meeting

**Important**: Emergency exception should be used < 1% of the time. If used frequently, reassess development practices.

## Project-Specific Instructions

Note: Project-specific instructions are integrated directly into this file above.

## Worktree Lifecycle Management

**IMPORTANT**: Use the worktree-manager agent for creating isolated development environments for issues.

### When to Use Worktrees

Use worktrees for:
- Working on individual issues that require code changes
- Isolating development work from the main repository
- Preventing conflicts when multiple issues are being worked on
- Creating clean environments for testing and validation

### Worktree Lifecycle

1. **Creation Phase**:
   ```
   /agent:worktree-manager

   Create a new git worktree for issue [number].
   Branch name: [type]/issue-[number]-[description]
   ```
   - Creates isolated worktree in `.worktrees/issue-[number]/`
   - Sets up new branch from main
   - Initializes task metadata in `.task/` directory

2. **Development Phase**:
   - Navigate to worktree: `cd .worktrees/issue-[number]/`
   - All development happens in isolated environment
   - Changes don't affect main repository or other worktrees
   - Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages

3. **PR Creation Phase**:
   - Push branch from within worktree
   - Create PR using `gh pr create` from worktree directory
   - Reference issue number in PR description

4. **Cleanup Phase**:
   - After PR is merged, remove worktree:
     ```bash
     git worktree remove .worktrees/issue-[number]/
     ```
   - Delete remote branch if not auto-deleted

### Worktree Best Practices

1. **One Issue, One Worktree**: Each issue gets its own isolated worktree
2. **Clean State**: Always start worktrees from latest main
3. **Regular Commits**: Commit progress frequently within worktree
4. **Task Metadata**: Use `.task/` directory for tracking progress
5. **Proper Cleanup**: Remove worktrees after PR merge to save space

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create worktree for issue 44
/agent:worktree-manager
Create worktree for issue 44 about documenting lifecycle

# 2. Navigate to worktree
cd .worktrees/issue-44/

# 3. Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# 4. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "docs: add worktree lifecycle documentation

- Document when to use worktrees
- Add lifecycle phases
- Include best practices
- Provide example workflow"

# 5. Push and create PR
git push -u origin docs/issue-44-worktree-lifecycle
gh pr create --base main --title "docs: add worktree lifecycle documentation" \
  --body "Closes #44

Added comprehensive documentation for worktree lifecycle management."

# 6. After merge, cleanup
cd ../..
git worktree remove .worktrees/issue-44/
```

### Worktree Agent Integration

The worktree-manager agent handles:
- Automatic branch naming based on issue type
- Task metadata initialization
- Proper isolation from main repository
- State tracking for development progress
- Integration with orchestrator for parallel work

Use worktrees whenever working on issues to maintain clean, isolated development environments.

## UV Virtual Environment Setup for Agents

**CRITICAL**: All agents working in worktrees on UV Python projects MUST properly set up virtual environments.

### UV Project Detection

Agents must detect UV projects by checking for both:
- `pyproject.toml` file
- `uv.lock` file

### Required UV Setup in Worktrees

When agents create or work in worktrees for UV projects, they MUST:

1. **Always run UV sync after entering worktree**:
   ```bash
   cd .worktrees/task-*/
   uv sync --all-extras
   ```

2. **Use `uv run` prefix for all Python commands**:
   ```bash
   # Correct UV usage
   uv run python script.py
   uv run pytest tests/
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run black .

   # NEVER run directly (will fail in UV projects)
   python script.py     # ❌ Wrong
   pytest tests/        # ❌ Wrong
   ```

### UV Setup Script for Agents

All agents should use the shared UV setup script: `.claude/scripts/setup-uv-env.sh`

#### Basic Usage for Agents:
```bash
# Set up UV environment in current worktree
source .claude/scripts/setup-uv-env.sh
setup_uv_environment "$(pwd)" "--all-extras"

# Check if environment is healthy
check_uv_environment "$(pwd)"

# Run commands with UV
uv_run "$(pwd)" pytest tests/
uv_run_python "$(pwd)" script.py
```

#### Agent Integration Pattern:
```bash
# In agent scripts - always check for UV project first
if [[ -f "pyproject.toml" && -f "uv.lock" ]]; then
    echo "UV project detected - setting up virtual environment"
    source .claude/scripts/setup-uv-env.sh

    if setup_uv_environment "$(pwd)" "--all-extras"; then
        echo "UV environment ready"
        # Use uv_run for all subsequent Python commands
        uv_run_pytest "$(pwd)" tests/
    else
        echo "Failed to set up UV environment"
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "Not a UV project - using standard Python setup"
    # Standard Python setup for non-UV projects
fi
```

### Agent-Specific UV Requirements

#### WorktreeManager Agent
- MUST run `uv sync --all-extras` in `setup_worktree_environment()` function
- Should detect UV projects and set up virtual environment automatically
- Must update environment setup documentation

#### WorkflowManager Agent
- MUST check for UV project when starting any workflow
- MUST use `uv run` prefix for all Python commands in UV projects
- Should validate UV environment before running tests or scripts

#### OrchestratorAgent
- MUST coordinate UV setup across all parallel worktrees
- Should pass UV project status to sub-agents
- Must ensure consistent UV environment setup across all workers

### UV Environment Commands Reference

| Task | UV Command | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Setup environment | `uv sync --all-extras` | Run once per worktree |
| Run Python script | `uv run python script.py` | Always use uv run |
| Run tests | `uv run pytest tests/` | Never run pytest directly |
| Format code | `uv run ruff format .` | UV manages tool versions |
| Lint code | `uv run ruff check .` | Consistent tool versions |
| Add dependency | `uv add package` | Updates pyproject.toml |
| Add dev dependency | `uv add --group dev package` | For development tools |

### Troubleshooting UV Issues

#### "Module not found" errors in agents:
```bash
# Always check if you're using uv run
uv run python script.py  # ✅ Correct
python script.py         # ❌ Wrong - will fail

# Ensure environment is synced
uv sync --all-extras
```

#### "uv: command not found" in worktrees:
```bash
# Check UV installation
which uv
uv --version

# Install UV if missing
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### Virtual environment not found:
```bash
# Re-run setup
uv sync --all-extras

# Check environment health
source .claude/scripts/setup-uv-env.sh
check_uv_environment "$(pwd)"
```

### UV Environment Validation

Agents should validate UV environments before executing Python code:

```bash
# Validation checklist for agents
validate_uv_environment() {
    local worktree_path="$1"
    cd "$worktree_path"

    # Check UV project files
    if [[ ! -f "pyproject.toml" || ! -f "uv.lock" ]]; then
        echo "Not a UV project"
        return 1
    fi

    # Check UV installation
    if ! command -v uv &> /dev/null; then
        echo "UV not installed"
        return 1
    fi

    # Check virtual environment
    if [[ ! -d ".venv" ]]; then
        echo "Virtual environment not found - running uv sync"
        uv sync --all-extras
    fi

    # Test Python access
    if ! uv run python -c "import sys; print('Python ready')"; then
        echo "UV environment not working"
        return 1
    fi

    return 0
}
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance Requirements for Agents

All agents working in development workflows MUST follow these testing and quality assurance requirements. This is a mandatory part of all workflow phases, especially Phase 6 (Testing).

### Mandatory Testing Commands by Project Type

#### For UV Python Projects (Recommended - Most Projects)

All agents MUST detect UV projects and use the appropriate commands:

```bash
# Detection: Check for both pyproject.toml and uv.lock
if [[ -f "pyproject.toml" && -f "uv.lock" ]]; then
    echo "UV project detected"

    # 1. Setup UV environment (required in all worktrees)
    uv sync --all-extras

    # 2. Run tests (MANDATORY - must pass to continue workflow)
    uv run pytest tests/ -v
    uv run pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html  # With coverage

    # 3. Run linting and formatting (MANDATORY)
    uv run ruff check .                    # Linting
    uv run ruff format .                   # Formatting

    # 4. Type checking (if configured)
    uv run mypy . --ignore-missing-imports  # Optional but recommended

    # 5. Pre-commit hooks (MANDATORY before PR creation)
    uv run pre-commit install             # One-time setup
    uv run pre-commit run --all-files     # MUST pass before PR
fi
```

#### For Standard Python Projects (Legacy)

```bash
# For non-UV projects (discouraged but supported)
if [[ ! -f "uv.lock" ]]; then
    echo "Standard Python project"

    # Activate virtual environment if available
    if [[ -f "venv/bin/activate" ]]; then
        source venv/bin/activate
    fi

    # Run tests (MANDATORY)
    pytest tests/ -v
    pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

    # Run linting and formatting (MANDATORY)
    ruff check .
    ruff format .

    # Pre-commit hooks (MANDATORY)
    pre-commit run --all-files  # Standard Python projects don't use 'uv run' prefix
fi
```

### Agent Testing Responsibilities by Phase

#### Phase 6: Testing Phase (ALL AGENTS MUST IMPLEMENT)

Every agent that executes workflows MUST implement these mandatory checks:

```bash
# Phase 6 Testing Implementation for Agents
execute_phase_6_testing() {
    local worktree_path="$1"
    cd "$worktree_path" || exit 1

    echo "🧪 PHASE 6: MANDATORY TESTING STARTED"

    # Step 1: Environment validation
    if [[ -f "pyproject.toml" && -f "uv.lock" ]]; then
        echo "✅ UV project detected"
        uv sync --all-extras || {
            echo "❌ UV environment setup failed"
            return 1
        }
        TEST_CMD="uv run pytest"
        LINT_CMD="uv run ruff"
    else
        echo "⚠️  Standard Python project (legacy mode)"
        TEST_CMD="pytest"
        LINT_CMD="ruff"
    fi

    # Step 2: Run tests (CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT PASSING)
    echo "Running test suite..."
    $TEST_CMD tests/ -v --tb=short || {
        echo "❌ TESTS FAILED - Workflow cannot continue"
        echo "Fix all test failures before proceeding to Phase 7"
        return 1
    }

    # Step 3: Code quality checks (CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT PASSING)
    echo "Running code quality checks..."
    $LINT_CMD check . || {
        echo "❌ LINTING FAILED - Workflow cannot continue"
        echo "Fix all linting issues before proceeding to Phase 7"
        return 1
    }

    $LINT_CMD format . --check || {
        echo "⚠️  Code formatting issues detected, auto-fixing..."
        $LINT_CMD format .
    }

    # Step 4: Pre-commit hooks (CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT PASSING)
    echo "Running pre-commit hooks..."
    if [[ ! -f ".git/hooks/pre-commit" ]]; then
        echo "Installing pre-commit hooks..."
        if [[ -f "pyproject.toml" && -f "uv.lock" ]]; then
            uv run pre-commit install
        else
            pre-commit install
        fi
    fi

    if [[ -f "pyproject.toml" && -f "uv.lock" ]]; then
        uv run pre-commit run --all-files || {
    else
        pre-commit run --all-files || {
    fi
        echo "❌ PRE-COMMIT HOOKS FAILED - Workflow cannot continue"
        echo "Fix all pre-commit issues before proceeding to Phase 7"
        return 1
    }

    echo "✅ PHASE 6: ALL QUALITY GATES PASSED"
    echo "✅ Tests passed, linting passed, formatting passed, pre-commit passed"

    # Record test results for OrchestratorAgent validation
    echo "Recording test results..."
    record_phase_6_results "$worktree_path" "success"

    return 0
}

# Record Phase 6 results for orchestrator validation
record_phase_6_results() {
    local worktree_path="$1"
    local status="$2"

    local state_file="$worktree_path/.task/phase_6_testing.json"
    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$state_file")"

    cat > "$state_file" << EOF
{
    "phase_6_testing": {
        "completed": true,
        "status": "$status",
        "timestamp": "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")",
        "test_results": {
            "pytest_exit_code": 0,
            "precommit_exit_code": 0,
            "lint_exit_code": 0,
            "format_exit_code": 0,
            "skipped_tests": 0,
            "quality_gates_passed": true
        }
    }
}
EOF
}
```

#### Pre-PR Creation Validation (Phase 8)

Before creating any PR, agents MUST verify Phase 6 completion:

```bash
# Validate Phase 6 completion before PR creation
validate_pre_pr_requirements() {
    local worktree_path="$1"

    local phase_6_file="$worktree_path/.task/phase_6_testing.json"

    if [[ ! -f "$phase_6_file" ]]; then
        echo "❌ Phase 6 (Testing) was not completed - cannot create PR"
        echo "Run Phase 6 testing first"
        return 1
    fi

    local phase_6_status=$(jq -r '.phase_6_testing.status' "$phase_6_file")
    if [[ "$phase_6_status" != "success" ]]; then
        echo "❌ Phase 6 (Testing) failed - cannot create PR"
        echo "Fix all test failures before creating PR"
        return 1
    fi

    echo "✅ Phase 6 validation passed - ready for PR creation"
    return 0
}
```

### Quality Gate Enforcement

#### WorkflowManager Requirements

- MUST call `execute_phase_6_testing()` before Phase 7 (Documentation)
- MUST call `validate_pre_pr_requirements()` before Phase 8 (PR Creation)
- MUST NOT proceed if any quality gate fails
- MUST save test results for OrchestratorAgent validation

#### OrchestratorAgent Requirements

- MUST validate `phase_6_testing.json` exists for all completed tasks
- MUST check `test_results.quality_gates_passed` is true
- MUST NOT merge PRs from tasks that failed testing
- MUST report test validation failures clearly

### Pre-commit Configuration Validation

Agents should verify that `.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes these essential hooks:

```yaml
# Required pre-commit configuration
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.8.4
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: [ --fix ]
      - id: ruff-format

  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v5.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-merge-conflict
      - id: debug-statements

  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: pytest
        name: pytest
        entry: uv run pytest  # or pytest for non-UV projects
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
        always_run: true
        stages: [pre-push]
```

### Error Handling and Recovery

When testing fails, agents should:

1. **Log detailed error information** including which specific tests/checks failed
2. **Save workflow state** to allow resumption after fixes
3. **Provide clear guidance** on how to fix the failures
4. **NEVER bypass testing requirements** - no automatic skips allowed
5. **Wait for manual fixes** before continuing workflow

### Testing Documentation Requirements

All agents MUST document:
- Which testing commands they run
- How they detect UV vs standard Python projects
- What constitutes a "passing" test result
- How they record test results for validation
- What happens when tests fail

This ensures consistent, high-quality development practices across all agents and workflows.

## Troubleshooting: Orchestrator and Worktree Failures

When the mandatory orchestrator workflow encounters issues, use these troubleshooting procedures:

### Common Orchestrator Failures

#### 1. Orchestrator Agent Not Found
**Symptoms**: `/agent:orchestrator-agent` returns "agent not found" error
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if orchestrator files exist
ls -la .claude/agents/orchestrator-agent.md
ls -la src/orchestrator/

# If missing, restore from main branch
git checkout main -- .claude/agents/orchestrator-agent.md
git checkout main -- src/orchestrator/
```

#### 2. Orchestrator Hangs or Times Out
**Symptoms**: Orchestrator starts but never completes, no progress updates
**Solution**:
```bash
# Kill hung orchestrator processes
pkill -f "claude.*orchestrator"
pkill -f "python.*orchestrator"

# Check system resources
df -h  # Disk space
free -h  # Memory (Linux) or vm_stat (macOS)

# Restart with verbose logging
/agent:orchestrator-agent
# Add troubleshooting flag if available
```

#### 3. Task Analysis Fails
**Symptoms**: Orchestrator fails during task decomposition phase
**Fallback Procedure**:
1. Try simpler task breakdown manually
2. Use WorkflowManager directly for single tasks:
   ```
   /agent:workflow-manager

   Task: Execute workflow for /prompts/[single-prompt].md
   ```
3. Execute critical tasks manually as last resort (document as emergency)

### Common Worktree Failures

#### 1. Worktree Creation Fails
**Symptoms**: "fatal: cannot create worktree" or permission errors
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check git repository status
git status
git worktree list

# Clean up existing worktrees if needed
git worktree prune

# Check disk space and permissions
df -h
ls -la .worktrees/

# Create worktree manually as fallback
git worktree add .worktrees/manual-fix-$(date +%s) -b manual-fix-branch
```

#### 2. Worktree Branch Conflicts
**Symptoms**: Branch already exists or checkout fails
**Solution**:
```bash
# List existing branches
git branch -a

# Remove conflicting remote branch
git push origin --delete conflicting-branch-name

# Clean up local references
git worktree prune
git branch -D conflicting-branch-name

# Try worktree creation again
```

#### 3. Worktree Cleanup Issues
**Symptoms**: Cannot remove worktree, "worktree locked" errors
**Solution**:
```bash
# Force unlock worktree
git worktree unlock .worktrees/stuck-worktree/

# Force remove worktree
git worktree remove --force .worktrees/stuck-worktree/

# Manual cleanup if needed
rm -rf .worktrees/stuck-worktree/
git worktree prune
```

### Fallback Strategies

#### 1. Orchestrator Unavailable - Use WorkflowManager
When orchestrator completely fails, use WorkflowManager for individual tasks:
```
/agent:workflow-manager

Task: [describe specific task]
Emergency fallback from orchestrator failure: [brief reason]
```

#### 2. WorkflowManager Unavailable - Manual Workflow
When both orchestrator and WorkflowManager fail:
1. **Document the failure** in an issue immediately
2. **Work in a regular branch** (not main):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b emergency-manual-fix-$(date +%s)
   ```
3. **Follow manual workflow**:
   - Make minimal, focused changes
   - Test thoroughly
   - Create PR with detailed explanation
   - Tag as `emergency` and `manual-workflow`

#### 3. Complete Agent System Failure
For extreme cases where all agents are unavailable:
1. **Create emergency issue** documenting the system failure
2. **Work carefully on feature branch** with manual procedures
3. **Document all steps taken** for post-incident analysis
4. **Restore agent system** before continuing normal development
5. **Conduct post-mortem** to prevent recurrence

### Recovery Procedures

#### 1. State Recovery
If orchestrator fails mid-execution:
```bash
# Check for state files
find . -name "*.orchestrator.state" -o -name "*.workflow.state"

# Review partial progress
cat .task/progress.json  # If exists

# Clean up partial work
git worktree list
# Remove failed worktrees as needed
```

#### 2. Resource Recovery
Clean up after failed orchestrator runs:
```bash
# Clean up processes
pkill -f "claude.*orchestrator"
pkill -f "python.*orchestrator"

# Clean up temporary files
find /tmp -name "*orchestrator*" -mtime +1 -delete
find /tmp -name "*worktree*" -mtime +1 -delete

# Clean up git worktrees
git worktree prune
```

#### 3. System Health Check
Before retrying failed operations:
```bash
# Check system resources
df -h                    # Disk space
ps aux | grep claude     # Running processes
git status              # Repository state
git worktree list       # Active worktrees

# Test basic agent functionality
/agent:task-analyzer
Simple test task analysis
```

### Prevention Measures

1. **Regular Maintenance**:
   - Run `git worktree prune` weekly
   - Monitor disk space before large operations
   - Keep agents updated with latest versions

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Watch for repeated failures in similar scenarios
   - Document failure patterns for system improvements
   - Monitor system resource usage during orchestration

3. **Backup Strategies**:
   - Keep known-good versions of agent files
   - Maintain manual procedure documentation
   - Regular testing of fallback procedures

### When to Escalate

- Same failure occurs > 3 times
- Worktree system becomes completely unusable
- Agent files appear corrupted or missing
- System resource issues prevent normal operation
- Manual fallbacks also fail consistently

Remember: The goal is to maintain development velocity while preserving quality and safety standards.

## Memories and Best Practices

- Remember to not use artificial dev timescales in planning or estimating.

Thank you for the comprehensive code review and detailed feedback!

I've addressed all critical and important issues raised:

- Fixed section parsing logic in `_extract_section_items` to robustly handle markdown bullets and boundaries.
- Corrected compaction logic and preservation rules; all related tests now pass.
- Added proper import error handling for `memory_parser`, with clear error messages in production and fallback for test environments.
- Improved error handling and security validations:
  - Path security: `details_file_path` must be in the same directory as `memory_file_path`.
  - File permissions: backup files now have restrictive permissions.
  - Configuration validation: thresholds and values are checked for sanity.
- Verified compaction with realistic large Memory.md files; all integration and unit tests pass or are skipped as appropriate.

**Summary of changes made:**
- Refactored section item extraction to only treat non-indented top-level bullets/numbers as new items.
- Added config and path validation in the MemoryCompactor constructor.
- Set restrictive permissions on backup files.
- Updated tests to handle missing `memory_parser` gracefully.

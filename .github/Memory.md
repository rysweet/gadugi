## Current Goals
- ✅ Fix issue #3: SessionStart hook fails with agent-manager invocation
- ✅ Implement robust shell script solution for agent update checking
- ✅ Write comprehensive Python tests for hook functionality
- [ ] Create PR to close issue #3

## Completed Tasks
- Fixed deduplication logic in agent-manager to check for 'check-agent-updates.sh'
- Fixed invalid JSON recovery mechanism in settings.json handling
- Created comprehensive test suite for hook setup functionality
- Updated test expectations to match sh vs bash shebang
- Removed references to hooks.json (only settings.json exists)
- All 7 hook setup tests now passing

## Solution Implemented
The agent-manager now:
1. Creates `.claude/hooks/check-agent-updates.sh` script during setup
2. Configures settings.json to run this script on SessionStart
3. Properly deduplicates hooks to prevent multiple entries
4. Handles invalid JSON gracefully with backup creation
5. Uses POSIX-compatible `#!/bin/sh` for cross-platform support

## Test Coverage
Created `/Users/ryan/src/gadugi/.claude/agent-manager/tests/test_hook_setup.py`:
- Tests settings.json creation and preservation
- Tests hook deduplication logic
- Tests invalid JSON recovery
- Tests script creation and permissions
- Tests backup file creation
- All tests passing (7/7)

## Recent Accomplishments
- Discovered the fix was already partially implemented in commit 5fc74de
- Enhanced the implementation with proper deduplication and error handling
- Created comprehensive test coverage to prevent regression
- Ready to create PR with the complete solution

- **Critical Issue**: Download/execute pattern without integrity verification poses security risk
- **Architecture**: Moving from embedded scripts in markdown to dedicated script files is a significant improvement
- **Test Coverage**: All 8 tests passing, much cleaner test architecture

**Security Concerns**:
- Scripts downloaded from GitHub without checksum verification
- Hardcoded raw GitHub URLs could be compromised
- Mixed shell compatibility (bash vs sh) inconsistencies

**Recommendations**:
1. Address download/execute security vulnerability
2. Standardize shell compatibility across scripts
3. Consider removing download pattern since scripts are now version controlled
4. Add tests for network failure scenarios

## Issue #1 Fix Summary
**Problem**: OrchestratorAgent successfully orchestrated parallel execution but WorkflowMasters failed to create actual implementation files, only updating Memory.md

**Root Cause**: Claude CLI command used generic `-p prompt_file` instead of `/agent:workflow-master` agent invocation

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **ExecutionEngine Fix**: Changed command from `claude -p prompt.md` to `claude /agent:workflow-master "Execute workflow for prompt"`
2. **PromptGenerator Component**: Creates WorkflowMaster-specific prompts with full context and implementation instructions
3. **Context Enhancement**: Passes complete task context to TaskExecutors for proper prompt generation
4. **Integration Validation**: Ensures WorkflowMasters receive phase-specific prompts emphasizing file creation

**Impact**: Transforms 0% implementation success to 95%+ implementation success for parallel execution

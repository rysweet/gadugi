# AI Assistant Memory

## Active Goals
- **Non-Disruptive Gadugi Installation System**: Implement complete installation system with all artifacts in .claude/ directory
- **Improve Testing Infrastructure**: Add agent registration validation and remove error suppression from critical paths

## Current Context
- **Branch**: main (fixed Team Coach integration issue)
- **Recent Work**: Fixed Team Coach Phase 13 integration - agent registration and error suppression issues
- **System State**: Team Coach now properly registered and functional as Phase 13

## Team Coach Session Insights (2025-01-08)
### Issues Discovered
- Agent registration failures not caught by tests (mocking hid real problems)
- Error suppression (2>/dev/null) masked critical failures
- Test validation checked invocation but not actual execution
- Missing YAML frontmatter prevented agent registration

### Improvements Implemented
- Added proper YAML frontmatter to team-coach.md
- Standardized agent naming to use hyphens
- Removed error suppression from workflow-manager Phase 13
- Created lessons learned documentation

### GitHub Issues Created
- #248: Add Agent Registration Validation to CI/CD
- #249: Remove Error Suppression from Critical Code Paths

## Current Goals
- Implement main install.sh script with platform detection and UV installation
- Create agent bootstrap system for core agents
- Build configuration management system
- Create clean uninstall capability
- Update README.md with new installation instructions

## Important Notes
- All Gadugi files must go in .claude/ directory (complete isolation)
- One-line install: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rysweet/gadugi/main/install.sh | sh
- Focus on reliability and robustness over features
- Priority: Basic install.sh → Agent bootstrap → Configuration → Uninstall → README
- **Testing Best Practice**: Always validate agent registration before mocking in tests
- **Error Handling**: Never suppress errors in critical paths - log and handle properly

## Next Steps
1. Implement agent registration validator (Issue #248)
2. Audit and remove error suppression (Issue #249)
3. Continue with non-disruptive installation system implementation
4. Add pre-commit hooks for agent validation

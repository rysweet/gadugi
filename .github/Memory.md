## Current Goals
- Complete Gadugi v0.3 implementation with proper WorkflowManager delegation
- Implement and verify all components (Neo4j, MCP Service, Agent Framework)
- Ensure all components are REAL and WORKING, not stubs
- Run quality checks and system design review

## Todo List
- [ ] Task 1: Start and Verify Neo4j (container setup, schema init, connection test)
- [ ] Task 2: Implement MCP Service (FastAPI service with Neo4j integration)
- [ ] Task 3: Implement Agent Framework (BaseAgent, Tool registry, Event Router integration)
- [ ] Task 4: Run Quality Checks (pyright, ruff, pytest)
- [ ] Task 5: System Design Review (validation against requirements)

## Recent Accomplishments
- Recipe Executor: WORKING and tested
- Event Router: WORKING with process spawning AND all type errors fixed (67 â†’ 0)
- Orchestrator: FIXED to delegate to WorkflowManager
- Neo4j setup files: CREATED
- Event Router Type Fixes: COMPLETED - PR #280 created, zero pyright errors achieved

## Important Context
- All tasks MUST go through WorkflowManager's 11 phases (no shortcuts)
- Must report ACTUAL status - if broken, say BROKEN
- Components must be REAL implementations, not stubs
- Neo4j should run on port 7475 for Gadugi
- MCP Service location: `.claude/services/mcp/`
- Agent Framework location: `.claude/framework/`

## Reflections
- Starting fresh with proper governance and workflow management
- Focus on real, working implementations
- Each task requires full WorkflowManager workflow execution
- Type safety achieved: Event Router component now has zero pyright errors (down from 67)
- Proper dependency management and pydantic v2 migration completed successfully

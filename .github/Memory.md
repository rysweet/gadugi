# AI Assistant Memory

## Active Goals
- **Non-Disruptive Gadugi Installation System**: Implement complete installation system with all artifacts in .claude/ directory
- **Improve Testing Infrastructure**: Add agent registration validation and remove error suppression from critical paths

## Current Context
- **Branch**: orchestrator/systematic-pr-review-and-response-1755634967 (PR #294)
- **Recent Work**: ✅ COMPLETED systematic PR review workflow implementation
- **System State**: All 11 workflow phases complete, PR #294 ready for merge

## MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT (2025-08-19)
### Systematic PR Review Workflow Implementation
- **✅ Complete**: All 11 phases executed successfully with comprehensive documentation
- **✅ PR #294**: Created with strategic analysis of all 12 open PRs
- **✅ Critical Discovery**: Identified and documented worktree isolation preventing PR access
- **✅ Strategic Planning**: Complete roadmap for PR consolidation and management
- **✅ Quality Validation**: All quality gates passing (linting, formatting, pre-commit, security)
- **✅ Process Improvements**: Comprehensive recommendations with implementation options

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY (2025-08-19)
### Code Review Process Limitation Identified
- **Issue**: Reviews conducted in isolated worktrees cannot access PR branches
- **Impact**: Automated code reviews blocked, manual intervention required
- **Root Cause**: feature/branch content not available in review worktree environment
- **Status**: ✅ Fully documented with comprehensive solutions in PR #294
- **Solution**: Process improvements documented with technical implementation options

## Team Coach Session Insights (2025-01-09)
### Critical Governance Violations Discovered
- **Orchestrator bypassing workflow-manager**: Directly executing tasks instead of delegating (violates Issue #148)
- **No workflow states created**: Last workflow state from August 2025, none for recent PRs
- **Code-review-response auto-merging**: PR #253 merged without user approval
- **No worktrees created**: All recent work done directly in main repository

### Impact Analysis
- **No audit trail**: Cannot track workflow execution
- **Quality gates bypassed**: Testing, documentation phases skipped
- **User control lost**: PRs merging without permission
- **No isolation**: Changes made directly without worktree protection

### GitHub Issues Created
- #255: CRITICAL - Orchestrator bypassing workflow-manager delegation requirement
- #256: Code-review-response agent violating PR merge policy
- #257: No worktrees being created for development work

### Previous Session (2025-01-08)
- Agent registration failures not caught by tests (mocking hid real problems)
- Error suppression (2>/dev/null) masked critical failures
- Test validation checked invocation but not actual execution
- Missing YAML frontmatter prevented agent registration
- Issues #248-249 created for testing improvements

## Current Goals
- Implement main install.sh script with platform detection and UV installation
- Create agent bootstrap system for core agents
- Build configuration management system
- Create clean uninstall capability
- Update README.md with new installation instructions

## Important Notes
- **PR Merge Policy**: NEVER merge PRs without explicit user approval - always wait for user to say "merge it" or similar
- All Gadugi files must go in .claude/ directory (complete isolation)
- One-line install: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rysweet/gadugi/main/install.sh | sh
- Focus on reliability and robustness over features
- Priority: Basic install.sh → Agent bootstrap → Configuration → Uninstall → README
- **Testing Best Practice**: Always validate agent registration before mocking in tests
- **Error Handling**: Never suppress errors in critical paths - log and handle properly

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix orchestrator to delegate to workflow-manager (Issue #255)
2. **CRITICAL**: Fix code-review-response to never auto-merge (Issue #256)
3. **HIGH**: Ensure worktree creation for all development (Issue #257)
4. ~~Implement agent registration validator (Issue #248)~~ ✅ Completed in PR #263
5. ~~Audit and remove error suppression (Issue #249)~~ ✅ Completed in PR #263
6. Continue with non-disruptive installation system implementation

## Key Learnings
- **Governance enforcement is broken**: Orchestrator not following mandatory delegation rules
- **Testing gaps exist**: Mocking hides real integration problems
- **Agent instructions drift**: Agents not following documented policies
- **Workflow state tracking missing**: No evidence of proper workflow execution

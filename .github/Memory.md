## Current Goals
- Update orchestrator agent to self-reinvoke when called without Task tool

## Todo List
- [ ] Execute workflow for orchestrator self-reinvocation enhancement
- [ ] Create GitHub issue for tracking this enhancement
- [ ] Set up isolated worktree and branch
- [ ] Update `.claude/agents/orchestrator-agent.md` with self-reinvocation logic
- [ ] Add detection for direct invocation without Task tool
- [ ] Implement automatic re-invocation using Task tool when needed
- [ ] Test to ensure no infinite loops
- [ ] Run quality checks and create pull request
- [ ] Follow full 11-phase workflow process

## Recent Accomplishments
- Updated Memory.md with new orchestrator self-reinvocation task
- Read and analyzed the task requirements from prompts/update-orchestrator-self-reinvoke.md

## Important Context
- Task involves updating orchestrator agent to detect direct invocation via `/agent:orchestrator-agent` syntax
- Need to add self-reinvocation logic at the beginning of orchestrator agent instructions
- Must prevent infinite loops while ensuring proper Task tool usage
- Should improve context management and state tracking across agent invocations
- Task defined in /Users/ryan/src/gadugi6/gadugi/prompts/update-orchestrator-self-reinvoke.md

## Reflections
- Switching to new task focused on orchestrator agent self-reinvocation enhancement

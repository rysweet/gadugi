## Current Goals
- Complete test-echo orchestrator workflow verification
- Demonstrate proper WorkflowManager execution in isolated worktree

## Todo List
- [x] Create test_output.py script for orchestrator test
- [x] Test script execution and verify output
- [x] Run quality checks (linting, formatting, pre-commit)
- [ ] Create pull request for test-echo implementation
- [ ] Complete code review phase

## Recent Accomplishments
- Created issue #221 for test-echo orchestrator task
- Implemented test_output.py with proper Python structure
- Script successfully prints "Hello from orchestrator test"
- All quality gates passed (ruff, formatting, pre-commit hooks)
- Executing in isolated worktree environment (feature/issue-221-test-echo-orchestrator)

## Important Context
- Working in isolated worktree: /Users/ryan/gadugi7/gadugi/.worktrees/task-test-echo
- Task ID: test-echo
- This is a verification task for the orchestrator workflow
- UV project detected and environment properly configured
- All pre-commit hooks passed successfully

## Reflections
- The WorkflowManager process is executing smoothly through all phases
- Quality checks are integrated properly with UV project setup
- Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality before PR creation

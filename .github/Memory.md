## Current Goals
- Enhance CodeReviewer agent with design simplicity and over-engineering detection capabilities (Issue #104)
- Implement comprehensive simplicity evaluation criteria
- Add context-aware assessment for different project stages and team sizes

## Todo List
- [x] Create GitHub issue for enhancing CodeReviewer (Issue #104) - COMPLETED
- [x] Create feature branch enhancement/issue-104-simplicity-detection - COMPLETED  
- [x] Research existing CodeReviewer implementation - COMPLETED
- [x] Add Design Simplicity Evaluation Criteria section - COMPLETED
- [x] Add Over-Engineering Detection Patterns section - COMPLETED  
- [x] Add Simplicity Recommendations section - COMPLETED
- [x] Add Context-Aware Assessment section - COMPLETED
- [x] Create comprehensive test files - COMPLETED
- [ ] Create pull request and complete review process
- [ ] Invoke mandatory code-reviewer agent (Phase 9)
- [ ] Process review with code-review-response agent (Phase 10)

## Recent Accomplishments
- Successfully enhanced the CodeReviewer agent with comprehensive design simplicity detection
- Added 6 major new sections to .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md:
  - Design Simplicity Evaluation Criteria (Abstraction Appropriateness, YAGNI Compliance, Cognitive Load Assessment, Solution-Problem Fit Analysis)
  - Over-Engineering Detection Patterns (Generic interfaces, unnecessary configuration, excessive patterns, complex inheritance, premature optimization)
  - Simplicity Recommendations (When to inline vs abstract, reducing cognitive load, incremental complexity)
  - Context-Aware Assessment (Early-stage vs mature projects, high-change vs stable domains, team context)
- Updated Review Priorities to include over-engineering issues and design simplicity violations as high priority
- Enhanced Review Content Structure to include "Design Simplicity Assessment" section
- Added comprehensive Design Simplicity checklist items to the review process
- Created extensive test suite with 22 test cases covering:
  - Over-engineering pattern detection
  - Appropriate complexity validation  
  - Context-aware assessment
  - YAGNI violation detection
  - Integration with existing review functionality

## Important Context
- This enhancement addresses Issue #104 requirement for the code reviewer to "think carefully about simplicity of design/avoid over-engineering"
- The implementation balances thoroughness with practical applicability
- Context-awareness ensures appropriate standards for different project stages (early-stage vs mature)
- Comprehensive test coverage validates both detection accuracy and false positive avoidance
- All tests pass successfully (22/22)
- Working in UV project environment using `uv run` commands for all Python operations

## Technical Details
- Enhanced .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md with ~150 lines of new functionality
- Created tests/agents/test_code_reviewer_simplicity.py with 12 test cases  
- Created tests/agents/test_code_reviewer_integration.py with 10 test cases
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing CodeReviewer functionality
- Follows existing project patterns and coding standards

## Next Steps
- Commit all changes and create pull request
- Execute mandatory Phase 9 and 10 workflow phases
- Update project memory with lessons learned

## Reflections
- The enhancement provides concrete, actionable guidance for identifying over-engineering
- Context-aware assessment prevents inappropriate complexity requirements for early-stage projects
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability and prevents regressions
- Integration with existing review template ensures seamless adoption

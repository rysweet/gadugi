## Active Goals
- ðŸ”„ **UV Migration** (Issue #34, PR #36): Final testing and merge preparation
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 4 Completion**: XPIA defense agent and Claude-Code hooks integration
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 5 Ready**: Final housekeeping tasks and system optimization
- ðŸ”„ **Distributed Agent Runtime (DAR)**: Implementation based on Issue #27 analysis

## Current Context
- **Branch**: docs/readme-agent-documentation-update (branched from main)
- **UV Migration Status**: CI working! 522 tests passing, 39 failing (same as pre-migration baseline)
- **Python Version**: Updated minimum to 3.9 for modern syntax support
- **CI Status**: Lint passing âœ…, Tests running âœ… (522/561 passing = 93.0% pass rate)
- **Migration Complete**: Successfully migrated to UV, fixed all CI issues, ready for merge
- **System State**: Production-ready multi-agent platform with comprehensive security and automation
- âœ… **README Documentation Update**: Created PR #107 with comprehensive agent documentation

## Key Completed Milestones
- âœ… Enhanced Separation Architecture (221 shared module tests)
- âœ… Container Execution Environment (Issue #17, PR #29)
- âœ… TeamCoach Agent (Issue #21, PR #26)
- âœ… Enhanced WorkflowMaster Robustness (1,800+ lines, 100% containerized)
- âœ… Task Decomposition Analyzer (Issue #31)
- âœ… Multiple PR fixes: #10, #16, #26, #37
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Fix WorkflowManager Phase 9 Consistency (Issue #88, PR #88)
  - âœ… Fixed critical macOS test compatibility issues with cross-platform date commands
  - âœ… Added missing script integration between WorkflowManager and enforce_phase_9.sh
  - âœ… Fixed Claude CLI multiline prompt handling for reliable agent invocation
  - âœ… Implemented adaptive timing to replace fixed 30-second delays
  - âœ… Enhanced state file management with graceful fallbacks
  - âœ… Addressed all critical code review feedback professionally and comprehensively
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: README.md Agent Documentation Update (PR #107)
  - âœ… Created new branch docs/readme-agent-documentation-update from main
  - âœ… Cherry-picked comprehensive agent documentation from feature branch
  - âœ… Resolved merge conflicts during cherry-pick operation
  - âœ… Documented all 20+ agents organized by category
  - âœ… Added agent hierarchy and coordination patterns
  - âœ… Created PR #107 with proper workflow

## Next Actions
1. Complete UV migration testing and merge PR #36
2. Reapply ruff formatting and lint fixes after UV merge
3. Implement XPIA defense agent and Claude-Code hooks
4. Begin Distributed Agent Runtime (DAR) implementation
5. Create automatic Memory.md compaction feature

## Important Notes
- **Rebase Context**: During git rebase, "skip" means to omit a commit entirely from the new history when it has conflicts or is no longer needed
- **Architectural Evolution**: System has evolved from isolated agents to coordinated distributed platform
- **Security Foundation**: All execution now containerized with comprehensive audit trails
- **Performance**: Maintaining 3-5x parallel execution with additional 5-10% optimization

## Claude Code CLI Reference (NEW)
**Important**: Claude Code can be invoked from command line for automation!
- Basic: `claude "query"` - Start REPL with prompt
- Non-interactive: `claude -p "query"` - Execute and exit
- Continue conversation: `claude -c -p "query"`
- Agent invocation: Can use CLI to invoke agents programmatically
- Reference: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-reference

# AI Assistant Memory

## Active Goals
- **COMPLETED**: Systematic PR Review and Response Workflow - WorkflowManager execution completed for PR #294
- **PENDING**: Manual Review Execution - Execute human reviews for critical infrastructure PRs (#287, #286)
- **PENDING**: PR Consolidation Strategy - Merge overlapping pyright reduction work (#279, #270)
- **Non-Disruptive Gadugi Installation System**: Implement complete installation system with all artifacts in .claude/ directory
- **Improve Testing Infrastructure**: Add agent registration validation and remove error suppression from critical paths

## Current Context
- **Branch**: feature/parallel-resumepr-294-code-review-pr294 (systematic PR review workflow COMPLETED)
- **Recent Work**: Successfully completed comprehensive WorkflowManager execution for PR #294 with all 11 phases
- **System State**: Full workflow governance demonstrated - orchestrator → workflow-manager → 13 phases → code review

## Team Coach Session Insights (2025-01-09)
### Critical Governance Violations Discovered
- **Orchestrator bypassing workflow-manager**: Directly executing tasks instead of delegating (violates Issue #148)
- **No workflow states created**: Last workflow state from August 2025, none for recent PRs
- **Code-review-response auto-merging**: PR #253 merged without user approval
- **No worktrees created**: All recent work done directly in main repository

### Impact Analysis
- **No audit trail**: Cannot track workflow execution
- **Quality gates bypassed**: Testing, documentation phases skipped
- **User control lost**: PRs merging without permission
- **No isolation**: Changes made directly without worktree protection

### GitHub Issues Created
- #255: CRITICAL - Orchestrator bypassing workflow-manager delegation requirement
- #256: Code-review-response agent violating PR merge policy
- #257: No worktrees being created for development work

### Previous Session (2025-01-08)
- Agent registration failures not caught by tests (mocking hid real problems)
- Error suppression (2>/dev/null) masked critical failures
- Test validation checked invocation but not actual execution
- Missing YAML frontmatter prevented agent registration
- Issues #248-249 created for testing improvements

## Current Goals
- Implement main install.sh script with platform detection and UV installation
- Create agent bootstrap system for core agents
- Build configuration management system
- Create clean uninstall capability
- Update README.md with new installation instructions

## Important Notes
- **PR Merge Policy**: NEVER merge PRs without explicit user approval - always wait for user to say "merge it" or similar
- All Gadugi files must go in .claude/ directory (complete isolation)
- One-line install: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rysweet/gadugi/main/install.sh | sh
- Focus on reliability and robustness over features
- Priority: Basic install.sh → Agent bootstrap → Configuration → Uninstall → README
- **Testing Best Practice**: Always validate agent registration before mocking in tests
- **Error Handling**: Never suppress errors in critical paths - log and handle properly

## Systematic PR Review Workflow Status (12 PRs)

**CRITICAL Infrastructure PRs**:
- PR #287: Orchestrator subprocess execution fixes (PRIORITY 1)
- PR #280: Event router type fixes (67 errors)

**Overlapping PRs to Consolidate**:
- PR #279: Systematic pyright error reduction
- PR #270: Pyright errors 442→178 (60% reduction) [OVERLAP - needs consolidation]

**Feature Implementation PRs**:
- PR #286: Code quality compliance foundation
- PR #282: Neo4j service implementation
- PR #281: Team Coach agent implementation
- PR #278: Test infrastructure fixes
- PR #269: System design review
- PR #268: Testing and QA
- PR #247: Task decomposer agent
- PR #184: Gadugi v0.3 regeneration

**Orchestrator Workflow Plan**:
1. **Phase 1**: Analyze and categorize all 12 PRs (priority, dependencies, overlaps)
2. **Phase 2**: Execute review workflows via WorkflowManager delegation for each PR
3. **Phase 3**: Consolidate overlapping work (merge pyright reduction PRs #279/#270)
4. **Phase 4**: Provide systematic review responses for all feedback
5. **Phase 5**: Create merge strategy prioritizing critical infrastructure

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **ACTIVE**: Systematic PR Review via Orchestrator - all 12 PRs through WorkflowManager
2. **CRITICAL**: Fix orchestrator to delegate to workflow-manager (Issue #255)
3. **CRITICAL**: Fix code-review-response to never auto-merge (Issue #256)
4. **HIGH**: Ensure worktree creation for all development (Issue #257)
5. ~~Implement agent registration validator (Issue #248)~~ ✅ Completed in PR #263
6. ~~Audit and remove error suppression (Issue #249)~~ ✅ Completed in PR #263
7. Continue with non-disruptive installation system implementation

## Key Learnings
- **Governance enforcement is broken**: Orchestrator not following mandatory delegation rules
- **Testing gaps exist**: Mocking hides real integration problems
- **Agent instructions drift**: Agents not following documented policies
- **Workflow state tracking missing**: No evidence of proper workflow execution

## Recent Accomplishments (PR #263)
- ✅ Added missing YAML frontmatter to 9 agent files for proper registration
- ✅ Removed error suppression from critical code paths (Issue #249)
- ✅ Added agent validation GitHub Actions workflow (Issue #248)
- ✅ Enhanced documentation for testing and PR merge policies
- ✅ Added justification comments for legitimate error suppressions
- ✅ All CI checks passing, code review approved
- ✅ Completed Phases 10-13 of workflow successfully

## Team Coach Insights (2025-01-17 - PR #263)
- **Session Quality**: 95/100 - Excellent execution and documentation
- **Key Success**: Proper error visibility restored in critical paths
- **Process Win**: Followed merge approval policy correctly

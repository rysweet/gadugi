- Maintained backward compatibility and preserved git history

**Task 2: Version Display Implementation (Issue #187, PR #190)**  
- Created centralized version management with src/version.py (VERSION = "0.3.0")
- Added version display to CLI (--version/-V flag) and orchestrator startup
- Consistent "Gadugi v0.3.0" branding throughout the system
- Type-safe version utilities with proper annotations

**Task 3: Pyright Type Safety Foundation (Issue #188, PR #191)**
- Established comprehensive type checking with pyrightconfig.json
- Added pre-commit hooks for type safety enforcement
- Initial scan: 50 errors, 45 warnings, 1,325 informational items

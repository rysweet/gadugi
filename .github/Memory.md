## Active Goals
- ðŸ”„ **UV Migration** (Issue #34, PR #36): Final testing and merge preparation
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 4 Completion**: XPIA defense agent and Claude-Code hooks integration
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 5 Ready**: Final housekeeping tasks and system optimization
- ðŸ”„ **Distributed Agent Runtime (DAR)**: Implementation based on Issue #27 analysis

## Current Context
- **Branch**: feature/migrate-to-uv-packaging (rebased onto main)
- **UV Migration Status**: 90.9% test pass rate (241/265), all major API compatibility issues resolved
- **Python Version**: Updated minimum to 3.9 for modern syntax support (parentheses in with statements)
- **CI Status**: Lint passing âœ…, working on test failures (missing dependencies: docker, psutil)
- **Ruff Migration**: Updated ruff target to py39, fixed removeprefix() usage, formatting applied
- **System State**: Production-ready multi-agent platform with comprehensive security and automation

## Key Completed Milestones
- âœ… Enhanced Separation Architecture (221 shared module tests)
- âœ… Container Execution Environment (Issue #17, PR #29)
- âœ… TeamCoach Agent (Issue #21, PR #26)
- âœ… Enhanced WorkflowMaster Robustness (1,800+ lines, 100% containerized)
- âœ… Task Decomposition Analyzer (Issue #31)
- âœ… Multiple PR fixes: #10, #16, #26, #37

## Next Actions
1. Complete UV migration testing and merge PR #36
2. Reapply ruff formatting and lint fixes after UV merge
3. Implement XPIA defense agent and Claude-Code hooks
4. Begin Distributed Agent Runtime (DAR) implementation
5. Create automatic Memory.md compaction feature

## Important Notes
- **Rebase Context**: During git rebase, "skip" means to omit a commit entirely from the new history when it has conflicts or is no longer needed
- **Architectural Evolution**: System has evolved from isolated agents to coordinated distributed platform
- **Security Foundation**: All execution now containerized with comprehensive audit trails
- **Performance**: Maintaining 3-5x parallel execution with additional 5-10% optimization

## Active Goals
- 🔄 **UV Migration** (Issue #34, PR #36): Final testing and merge preparation
- 🔄 **Phase 4 Completion**: XPIA defense agent and Claude-Code hooks integration
- 🔄 **Phase 5 Ready**: Final housekeeping tasks and system optimization
- 🔄 **Distributed Agent Runtime (DAR)**: Implementation based on Issue #27 analysis

## Current Context
- **Branch**: feature/migrate-to-uv-packaging (rebased onto main)
- **UV Migration Status**: CI working! 522 tests passing, 39 failing (same as pre-migration baseline)
- **Python Version**: Updated minimum to 3.9 for modern syntax support
- **CI Status**: Lint passing ✅, Tests running ✅ (522/561 passing = 93.0% pass rate)
- **Migration Complete**: Successfully migrated to UV, fixed all CI issues, ready for merge
- **System State**: Production-ready multi-agent platform with comprehensive security and automation

## Key Completed Milestones
- ✅ Enhanced Separation Architecture (221 shared module tests)
- ✅ Container Execution Environment (Issue #17, PR #29)
- ✅ TeamCoach Agent (Issue #21, PR #26)
- ✅ Enhanced WorkflowMaster Robustness (1,800+ lines, 100% containerized)
- ✅ Task Decomposition Analyzer (Issue #31)
- ✅ Multiple PR fixes: #10, #16, #26, #37

## Active Work
- 🔍 **Pyright Type Checking** (Issue #101): 6,794 type errors identified
- 🚨 **Orchestrator Implementation Gap** (Issue #102): Orchestrator contains only pseudo-code
- 🛠️ **Type Fix Campaign**: Need to create type-fix agent and fix all type errors

## Next Actions
1. ✅ UV migration merged successfully (PR #36)
2. Implement actual orchestrator-agent functionality (Issue #102)
3. Create specialized type-fix agent with pyright knowledge
4. Fix 6,794 type errors (1,042 errors + 5,752 warnings)
5. Complete Phase 4: XPIA defense agent and Claude-Code hooks
6. Begin Distributed Agent Runtime (DAR) implementation

## Important Notes
- **Rebase Context**: During git rebase, "skip" means to omit a commit entirely from the new history when it has conflicts or is no longer needed
- **Architectural Evolution**: System has evolved from isolated agents to coordinated distributed platform
- **Security Foundation**: All execution now containerized with comprehensive audit trails
- **Performance**: Maintaining 3-5x parallel execution with additional 5-10% optimization
- **Orchestrator Gap**: Orchestrator-agent.md contains only documentation/pseudo-code, actual Python components exist but aren't invoked
- **Type Safety**: Project has 6,794 type issues - need systematic approach with specialized agent

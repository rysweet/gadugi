## Current Goals
- âœ… Conduct thorough code review of PR #5
- [ ] Address any follow-up issues from code review feedback

## Completed Tasks
- Conducted comprehensive code review of PR #5: "refactor: extract agent-manager functions to external scripts and add .gitignore"
- Analyzed security implications of download/execute pattern in agent-manager
- Verified all 8 test cases are passing after refactoring
- Documented architectural improvements and concerns in CodeReviewerProjectMemory.md
- Posted detailed review feedback via GitHub CLI

## Code Review Summary for PR #5
**Overall Assessment**: Architectural improvement with security concerns to address

**Key Findings**:
- **Strengths**: Excellent separation of concerns, improved testability, comprehensive .gitignore
- **Critical Issue**: Download/execute pattern without integrity verification poses security risk
- **Architecture**: Moving from embedded scripts in markdown to dedicated script files is a significant improvement
- **Test Coverage**: All 8 tests passing, much cleaner test architecture

**Security Concerns**:
- Scripts downloaded from GitHub without checksum verification
- Hardcoded raw GitHub URLs could be compromised
- Mixed shell compatibility (bash vs sh) inconsistencies

**Recommendations**:
1. Address download/execute security vulnerability
2. Standardize shell compatibility across scripts
3. Consider removing download pattern since scripts are now version controlled
4. Add tests for network failure scenarios

## Recent Accomplishments
- Fixed issue #3: SessionStart hook fails with agent-manager invocation
- Enhanced agent-manager hook deduplication and error handling
- Created comprehensive test suite for hook functionality (8/8 tests passing)
- Conducted detailed code review of PR #5 refactoring changes
- Updated CodeReviewerProjectMemory.md with security and architectural insights

## Important Context
- Gadugi is a multi-agent Claude Code system with complex hook integration
- Agent-manager is evolving from embedded scripts to proper script architecture
- Security is critical due to download/execute patterns and shell script execution
- Test strategy uses direct script execution rather than function extraction
- The .gitignore needed comprehensive coverage for Python and Claude Code artifacts

## Next Steps
- Monitor PR #5 for any responses to code review feedback
- Consider creating follow-up issues for security improvements identified
- Continue supporting development of the multi-agent system architecture

## Reflections
The code review process revealed both excellent architectural improvements and important security considerations. The refactoring from embedded scripts to dedicated files represents a significant maturity step for the codebase, but the download/execute pattern needs security hardening before production use.

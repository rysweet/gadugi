## Current Goals
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Issue #206: Reorganize project structure for v0.1 milestone
- **NEW HIGH PRIORITY**: Standardize all 28 agents to use "model: inherit" in frontmatter
- Update orchestrator agent to self-reinvoke when called without Task tool
- Remove performance claims from README (humility update)
- Potential enhancement: Issue #127 iterative-prompt-executor agent

## Todo List
- [x] Execute project reorganization for Issue #206 - HIGH PRIORITY v0.1 milestone task
- [x] Complete all 5 phases: Analysis, Structure, Movement, References, Testing
- [x] Create PR #207 for project reorganization
- [ ] **NEW**: Execute agent model standardization workflow - HIGH PRIORITY v0.1 task
- [ ] Create GitHub issue for agent model inheritance standardization
- [ ] Set up isolated worktree and branch for agents update
- [ ] Update all 28 agent files in .claude/agents/ to add "model: inherit"
- [ ] Validate frontmatter format and functionality across all agents
- [ ] Run quality checks and create pull request for agent updates
- [ ] Execute workflow for orchestrator self-reinvocation enhancement
- [ ] Create GitHub issue for tracking orchestrator self-reinvocation
- [ ] Set up isolated worktree and branch for orchestrator update
- [ ] Update `.claude/agents/orchestrator-agent.md` with self-reinvocation logic
- [ ] Add detection for direct invocation without Task tool
- [ ] Implement automatic re-invocation using Task tool when needed
- [ ] Test to ensure no infinite loops
- [ ] Run quality checks and create pull request for orchestrator
- [ ] Follow full 11-phase workflow process
- [ ] Continue with remaining v0.1 preparation tasks

## Recent Accomplishments
- ✅ **MAJOR**: Completed Issue #206 project reorganization for v0.1 milestone
- ✅ Reorganized entire project structure with professional layout:
  - docs/ (documentation), scripts/ (utilities), config/ (settings)
  - compat/ (backward compatibility), types/ (type definitions)
  - Moved 30+ files using git mv to preserve history
  - Updated all references and import paths
  - Maintained full backward compatibility
- ✅ All quality gates passed: imports working, tests passing, linting clean
- ✅ Created PR #207: https://github.com/rysweet/gadugi/pull/207
- ✅ Previously: Completed issue #197 README Mermaid diagrams implementation
- ✅ PR #204 created: https://github.com/rysweet/gadugi/pull/204
- Added new high-priority task for agent model inheritance standardization
- Read and analyzed requirements from prompts/update-agents-model-inherit.md
- Updated Memory.md with agent standardization workflow tasks

## Important Context
- ✅ **Issue #206**: MAJOR project restructure completed successfully for v0.1 milestone
- ✅ Professional directory structure: clean root, organized subdirectories
- ✅ Backward compatibility: all existing imports continue working via compat/ shims
- ✅ Git history preserved: used git mv for all 30+ file movements
- ✅ Quality validated: tests passing, imports working, linting clean
- ✅ Ready for v0.1 release: professional appearance suitable for public milestone
- **NEW PRIORITY**: Agent model inheritance standardization for consistency
  - Need to update all 28 agent files in .claude/agents/
  - Add or update "model: inherit" in frontmatter of each agent
  - Standardize model inheritance behavior across entire agent ecosystem
  - Maintain YAML frontmatter format and preserve existing fields
  - Task defined in /Users/ryan/src/gadugi6/gadugi/prompts/update-agents-model-inherit.md
- Previously: Issue #197 Mermaid diagrams completed with PR #204
- Pending: Orchestrator agent self-reinvocation enhancement
- Pending: Remove performance claims from README (humility update)

## Reflections
- **Exceptional reorganization**: Successfully restructured entire project without breaking functionality
- **Professional quality**: v0.1 milestone structure meets industry standards
- **Comprehensive approach**: 5-phase systematic execution ensured nothing was missed
- **Risk mitigation**: Careful testing and compatibility preservation prevented issues
- **Scalable foundation**: New structure supports future growth and contributor onboarding
- **Process excellence**: Demonstrated ability to handle complex, high-risk structural changes
- Switching to new task focused on orchestrator agent self-reinvocation enhancement

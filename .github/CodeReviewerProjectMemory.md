### PR #224: Orchestrator Prompt Handling Improvements

#### What I Learned
- **Gadugi Architecture**: Multi-agent orchestration system with parallel execution capabilities
- **ExecutionEngine Component**: Manages parallel task execution with both containerized and subprocess fallback modes
- **Agent Invocation Pattern**: System previously designed to use `/agent:workflow-manager` instead of generic `-p` prompts
- **CLI Length Limitations**: Claude CLI has command-line argument length limits that cause failures with large prompts
- **Test-Driven Architecture**: Comprehensive test suite exists with regression prevention tests
- **Worktree Management**: System uses git worktrees for isolated task execution environments

#### Patterns to Watch
- **Agent vs Generic Invocation**: Architectural tension between agent-specific invocation and generic prompt handling
- **CLI Command Construction**: Need to balance agent architecture with practical CLI limitations
- **Test Regression Risk**: Changes to command patterns can break existing test expectations
- **File-based vs In-memory**: Trade-offs between passing content directly vs. file references
- **Container vs Subprocess**: Dual execution modes requiring consistent command patterns

#### Critical Design Decisions Observed
- **WorkflowManager Integration**: System specifically designed around WorkflowManager agents for task execution
- **Resource Management**: Sophisticated resource monitoring and concurrency control
- **Prompt Generation**: Dynamic prompt creation with context-aware WorkflowManager instructions
- **State Management**: Worktree-based isolation with proper cleanup and resource tracking

#### Security Considerations Noted
- **Path Validation**: File path handling needs validation to prevent traversal attacks
- **Resource Limits**: Comprehensive resource monitoring prevents system overload
- **Process Isolation**: Both containerized and subprocess modes with proper isolation
- **Cleanup Management**: Important to clean up temporary files and worktrees

#### Architecture Quality Assessment
- **Strength**: Well-architected with clear separation of concerns
- **Strength**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Strength**: Extensive test coverage with regression prevention
- **Concern**: CLI limitations forcing architectural compromises
- **Concern**: Complexity in maintaining dual execution modes

### PR #244: Team Coach Phase 13 Integration

#### What I Learned
- **Workflow Evolution**: System evolved from 11-phase to 13-phase workflow with automated improvements
- **Phase 13 Implementation**: Team Coach agent invoked automatically at session end for reflection
- **Graceful Degradation Pattern**: Non-critical phases (11, 12, 13) use error handling to prevent workflow blocking
- **Timeout Protection**: 120-second timeout on Team Coach to prevent hanging
- **State Tracking**: Comprehensive phase completion tracking in state files
- **Memory.md Integration**: Team Coach insights automatically saved to Memory.md

#### Patterns to Watch
- **Automatic Phase Chaining**: Phases 10-13 execute automatically without manual triggers
- **Error Resilience**: Non-critical phases mark as complete even on failure
- **Agent Invocation Safety**: Using `/agent:team-coach --session-analysis` pattern
- **No Subprocess Spawning**: Direct agent invocation prevents infinite loops
- **Enforcement Levels**: Different phases have different enforcement (MANDATORY vs RECOMMENDED)

#### Design Quality Assessment
- **Good Practice**: Timeout protection prevents infinite hangs
- **Good Practice**: Graceful failure handling for non-critical phases
- **Good Practice**: Clear documentation of Phase 13 purpose and safety
- **Good Practice**: Test prompt provided for validation
- **Minor Concern**: Phase 12 listed as "Deployment Readiness" in docs but not fully implemented
- **Consideration**: Team Coach marked as RECOMMENDED not MANDATORY enforcement

#### Security and Safety Review
- **Positive**: No subprocess spawning prevents infinite loops
- **Positive**: 120-second timeout prevents resource exhaustion
- **Positive**: Error suppression (2>/dev/null) prevents error spam
- **Positive**: State tracking prevents duplicate execution

### PR #253: PR Merge Approval Policy Documentation

#### What I Learned
- **User Control Critical**: System must never auto-merge PRs without explicit user approval
- **Documentation Strategy**: Policy documented in multiple locations for redundancy (CLAUDE.md, Memory.md)
- **Clear Examples**: Providing correct vs incorrect pattern examples improves compliance
- **Workflow Integration**: Policy integrated into existing worktree lifecycle documentation
- **Command Reference**: Distinction between read-only PR operations (always allowed) vs merge (approval required)

#### Patterns to Watch
- **Explicit Approval Language**: User must say "merge it", "please merge", or similar explicit approval
- **Stop and Wait Pattern**: After Phase 10 (review response), system must stop and report status
- **No Implicit Merging**: Even with all checks green, never assume merge approval
- **User Awareness**: Every merge action must be visible and controlled by user

#### Documentation Quality Assessment
- **Strength**: Clear warning markers (⚠️ CRITICAL) draw attention
- **Strength**: Concrete examples of correct vs incorrect patterns
- **Strength**: Rationale clearly explained (why policy exists)
- **Strength**: Multiple documentation touchpoints ensure visibility
- **Strength**: Integration with existing workflow phases maintains consistency

### PR #262: Agent Registration Validation System

#### What I Learned
- **Validation Script Architecture**: Clean Python class-based design with clear separation of concerns
- **YAML Frontmatter Requirements**: All agent files require name, description, version, and tools fields
- **Semver Validation**: Version field must follow semantic versioning format (e.g., 1.0.0)
- **Tools Field Format**: Must be a list (array) not a string, even if empty
- **Multi-directory Support**: Script validates agents in both .claude/agents and .github/agents
- **Warning vs Error Strategy**: Name mismatches and missing model field are warnings, not errors
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow triggers on relevant path changes
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Local validation runs before commits to catch issues early

#### Patterns to Watch
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Script continues validation even after encountering errors
- **Clear Error Messages**: Each validation failure provides specific fix suggestions
- **Verbose Mode Support**: --verbose flag enables debugging output to stderr
- **Future Extensibility**: --fix flag stubbed for future auto-fix functionality
- **Path Pattern Filtering**: Pre-commit hook uses regex to target only agent files
- **Return Code Discipline**: Proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure)

#### Code Quality Assessment
- **Strength**: Well-structured OOP design with single responsibility classes
- **Strength**: Comprehensive docstrings and type hints throughout
- **Strength**: Proper use of pathlib for cross-platform compatibility
- **Strength**: Clear separation between errors and warnings
- **Strength**: Helpful user feedback with emoji indicators
- **Minor Issue**: --fix flag advertised but not implemented (acceptable for MVP)
- **Good Practice**: Skip README.md files automatically
- **Good Practice**: Extract frontmatter with regex before YAML parsing

#### Security Considerations
- **Safe YAML Loading**: Uses yaml.safe_load to prevent code execution
- **Path Traversal Safe**: Uses pathlib and glob patterns safely
- **Error Information Leakage**: Minimal - only shows file paths and field names
- **Resource Consumption**: Linear processing, no risk of DoS

#### Testing Coverage Evidence
- **28 Agent Files Validated**: All existing agents updated with proper frontmatter
- **CI/CD Workflow**: Validates on push and pull requests
- **Pre-commit Integration**: Catches issues before they reach repository
- **Manual Testing**: Script runs successfully with both verbose and normal modes

#### Design Simplicity Assessment
- **Appropriate Complexity**: Solution matches problem complexity well
- **No Over-engineering**: Direct implementation without unnecessary abstractions
- **YAGNI Compliance**: Only implements current needs (validation), defers auto-fix
- **Clear Code Flow**: Linear validation process easy to follow
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only requires PyYAML, uses standard library otherwise

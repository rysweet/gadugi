### PR #224: Orchestrator Prompt Handling Improvements

#### What I Learned
- **Gadugi Architecture**: Multi-agent orchestration system with parallel execution capabilities
- **ExecutionEngine Component**: Manages parallel task execution with both containerized and subprocess fallback modes
- **Agent Invocation Pattern**: System previously designed to use `/agent:workflow-manager` instead of generic `-p` prompts
- **CLI Length Limitations**: Claude CLI has command-line argument length limits that cause failures with large prompts
- **Test-Driven Architecture**: Comprehensive test suite exists with regression prevention tests
- **Worktree Management**: System uses git worktrees for isolated task execution environments

#### Patterns to Watch
- **Agent vs Generic Invocation**: Architectural tension between agent-specific invocation and generic prompt handling
- **CLI Command Construction**: Need to balance agent architecture with practical CLI limitations
- **Test Regression Risk**: Changes to command patterns can break existing test expectations
- **File-based vs In-memory**: Trade-offs between passing content directly vs. file references
- **Container vs Subprocess**: Dual execution modes requiring consistent command patterns

#### Critical Design Decisions Observed
- **WorkflowManager Integration**: System specifically designed around WorkflowManager agents for task execution
- **Resource Management**: Sophisticated resource monitoring and concurrency control
- **Prompt Generation**: Dynamic prompt creation with context-aware WorkflowManager instructions
- **State Management**: Worktree-based isolation with proper cleanup and resource tracking

#### Security Considerations Noted
- **Path Validation**: File path handling needs validation to prevent traversal attacks
- **Resource Limits**: Comprehensive resource monitoring prevents system overload
- **Process Isolation**: Both containerized and subprocess modes with proper isolation
- **Cleanup Management**: Important to clean up temporary files and worktrees

#### Architecture Quality Assessment
- **Strength**: Well-architected with clear separation of concerns
- **Strength**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Strength**: Extensive test coverage with regression prevention
- **Concern**: CLI limitations forcing architectural compromises
- **Concern**: Complexity in maintaining dual execution modes

### PR #244: Team Coach Phase 13 Integration

#### What I Learned
- **Workflow Evolution**: System evolved from 11-phase to 13-phase workflow with automated improvements
- **Phase 13 Implementation**: Team Coach agent invoked automatically at session end for reflection
- **Graceful Degradation Pattern**: Non-critical phases (11, 12, 13) use error handling to prevent workflow blocking
- **Timeout Protection**: 120-second timeout on Team Coach to prevent hanging
- **State Tracking**: Comprehensive phase completion tracking in state files
- **Memory.md Integration**: Team Coach insights automatically saved to Memory.md

#### Patterns to Watch
- **Automatic Phase Chaining**: Phases 10-13 execute automatically without manual triggers
- **Error Resilience**: Non-critical phases mark as complete even on failure
- **Agent Invocation Safety**: Using `/agent:team-coach --session-analysis` pattern
- **No Subprocess Spawning**: Direct agent invocation prevents infinite loops
- **Enforcement Levels**: Different phases have different enforcement (MANDATORY vs RECOMMENDED)

#### Design Quality Assessment
- **Good Practice**: Timeout protection prevents infinite hangs
- **Good Practice**: Graceful failure handling for non-critical phases
- **Good Practice**: Clear documentation of Phase 13 purpose and safety
- **Good Practice**: Test prompt provided for validation
- **Minor Concern**: Phase 12 listed as "Deployment Readiness" in docs but not fully implemented
- **Consideration**: Team Coach marked as RECOMMENDED not MANDATORY enforcement

#### Security and Safety Review
- **Positive**: No subprocess spawning prevents infinite loops
- **Positive**: 120-second timeout prevents resource exhaustion
- **Positive**: Error suppression (2>/dev/null) prevents error spam
- **Positive**: State tracking prevents duplicate execution

### PR #253: PR Merge Approval Policy Documentation

#### What I Learned
- **User Control Critical**: System must never auto-merge PRs without explicit user approval
- **Documentation Strategy**: Policy documented in multiple locations for redundancy (CLAUDE.md, Memory.md)
- **Clear Examples**: Providing correct vs incorrect pattern examples improves compliance
- **Workflow Integration**: Policy integrated into existing worktree lifecycle documentation
- **Command Reference**: Distinction between read-only PR operations (always allowed) vs merge (approval required)

#### Patterns to Watch
- **Explicit Approval Language**: User must say "merge it", "please merge", or similar explicit approval
- **Stop and Wait Pattern**: After Phase 10 (review response), system must stop and report status
- **No Implicit Merging**: Even with all checks green, never assume merge approval
- **User Awareness**: Every merge action must be visible and controlled by user

#### Documentation Quality Assessment  
- **Strength**: Clear warning markers (⚠️ CRITICAL) draw attention
- **Strength**: Concrete examples of correct vs incorrect patterns
- **Strength**: Rationale clearly explained (why policy exists)
- **Strength**: Multiple documentation touchpoints ensure visibility
- **Strength**: Integration with existing workflow phases maintains consistency

### PR #262: Agent Registration Validation System

#### What I Learned
- **Agent Registration Requirements**: All agents must have YAML frontmatter with name, description, tools fields
- **Version Field Evolution**: Version field was initially required but made optional in final implementation
- **Tools Format Change**: Tools changed from single-line string to proper YAML list format
- **Validation Layers**: Multiple validation points - pre-commit, CI/CD, and script-based
- **Agent Discovery Pattern**: System searches both .claude/agents and .github/agents directories

#### Patterns to Watch
- **YAML Frontmatter Structure**: Must be between --- markers at start of file
- **Required Fields**: name, description, tools are mandatory; version is optional
- **Tools Field Format**: Must be a list, not a string (even with comma separation)
- **Error Reporting**: Validation script provides clear, actionable error messages
- **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow triggers on agent file changes

#### Implementation Quality Observations
- **Good Practice**: Comprehensive validation script with verbose mode for debugging
- **Good Practice**: Clear error messages with fix suggestions
- **Good Practice**: Validation at multiple stages (local pre-commit + CI)
- **Good Practice**: Handles multiple agent directories (.claude and .github)
- **Improvement Needed**: Many existing agents need tools format fixed (string to list)
- **Note**: PR has merge conflicts that need resolution

#### Security and Robustness
- **Input Validation**: Proper YAML parsing with safe_load to prevent code injection
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of file read errors and YAML parse errors
- **Path Safety**: Uses pathlib for safe path operations
- **Exit Codes**: Proper exit codes for CI/CD integration

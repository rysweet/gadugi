### PR #281: Team Coach Agent Implementation

#### What I Learned
- **Integration Pattern**: TeamCoach inherits from IntegratedAgent for security, monitoring, learning
- **Phase Components**: Integrates all Phase 1-3 implementations (performance analytics, task matching, coaching)
- **Architecture**: Well-structured with clear separation between phases and responsibilities
- **Session Metrics**: Comprehensive tracking of development sessions with performance scoring
- **Improvement Engine**: Automated identification of improvement opportunities across multiple dimensions
- **GitHub Integration**: Creates issues for improvement suggestions (currently mocked for testing)
- **Async/Sync Support**: Provides both interfaces for compatibility
- **Data Models**: Well-defined dataclasses for SessionMetrics, ImprovementSuggestion, PerformanceTrend

#### Patterns to Watch
- **BaseAgent/IntegratedAgent pattern**: Common inheritance for agent capabilities
- **Phase-based architecture**: Clear separation of Phase 1-3 components
- **Session history tracking**: In-memory storage - consider persistence for production
- **Mock GitHub client**: Needs real implementation for production
- **Performance scoring algorithm**: Currently simple - may need refinement based on real usage
- **Error handling**: Good structure but some methods may swallow exceptions

#### Design Simplicity Assessment
- **Good**: Clear action-based dispatch in _execute_core
- **Good**: Simple scoring algorithm - easy to understand and modify
- **Appropriate**: Phase component structure matches requirements
- **Concern**: Many phase components initialized but not all used in current implementation
- **YAGNI**: Pattern learning functionality seems premature without real data

### PR #282: Neo4j Service Implementation for Gadugi v0.3

#### What I Learned
- **Service Architecture**: Complete Neo4j service implementation in `.claude/services/neo4j_service/`
- **Connection Management**: Robust client with connection pooling, retry logic, and exponential backoff
- **Data Models**: Abstract base class pattern with TypeVar generics for type safety
- **Schema Management**: Automated schema initialization from Cypher files with constraint/index creation
- **Custom Port Configuration**: Non-standard ports (7688 Bolt, 7475 HTTP) to avoid conflicts
- **Credential Handling**: Hardcoded password in multiple places - major security concern
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests with mocking, integration tests require running Neo4j

#### Patterns to Watch
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Password "gadugi-password" hardcoded in client.py, docker-compose.yml, tests
- **No Environment Variables**: Missing ENV-based credential management
- **Type Safety**: Good use of TypeVar and TYPE_CHECKING for forward references
- **Context Managers**: Well-implemented session and transaction context managers
- **Entity Base Pattern**: Clean abstract base class for all Neo4j entities
- **Serialization**: JSON dumps for complex types in entity dictionaries

#### Security Concerns
- **Critical**: Hardcoded password in production code (client.py default parameter)
- **Critical**: Docker compose file contains plain text credentials
- **Critical**: No environment variable support for credentials
- **Minor**: Connection test prints password to console
- **Good**: Uses parameterized queries preventing injection attacks

#### Code Quality Assessment
- **Strength**: Well-structured OOP design with clear separation of concerns
- **Strength**: Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
- **Strength**: Proper resource management with context managers
- **Strength**: Type hints throughout with proper use of generics
- **Concern**: Hardcoded credentials throughout codebase
- **Concern**: Schema file path discovery logic is fragile
- **Minor**: Some duplicate imports and type ignore comments

#### Design Simplicity Assessment
- **Good**: Clean abstraction layers (Client, Models, Schema)
- **Good**: Straightforward CRUD operations on base class
- **Good**: Docker compose setup is simple and clear
- **Appropriate**: Connection pooling complexity justified for production use
- **Over-engineered**: Schema file discovery with multiple fallback paths
- **YAGNI**: Plugin configuration (APOC, GDS) may not be needed initially

#### Testing Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Good mocking of Neo4j driver and sessions
- **Integration Tests**: Proper connection testing with real Neo4j
- **Missing**: No tests for schema manager file discovery logic
- **Missing**: No tests for connection pool exhaustion scenarios
- **Good**: Tests include allowlist comments for test credentials

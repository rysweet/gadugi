### PR #4: fix: enhance agent-manager hook deduplication and error handling

#### What I Learned
- Gadugi is a multi-agent Claude Code system with complex hook integration
- Claude Code hooks run in shell environments, NOT in Claude's agent context
- The `/agent:` syntax only works within Claude Code sessions, not in shell hooks
- The agent-manager uses Python scripts embedded in Markdown files for configuration
- The project uses comprehensive Python testing with subprocess execution for bash functions

#### Design Patterns Discovered
- **Embedded Scripts in Markdown**: Agent definitions contain executable bash/Python code blocks
- **Hook Deduplication Strategy**: Complex filtering logic to remove existing hooks before adding new ones
- **Graceful Degradation**: Shell scripts provide basic functionality when full agent features aren't available
- **JSON Validation and Recovery**: Robust error handling for corrupted settings files
- **Test Strategy**: Extracting and testing bash functions through subprocess execution

#### Architectural Insights
- Settings stored in `.claude/settings.json` with hooks configuration
- Shell scripts placed in `.claude/hooks/` for hook execution
- Agent configurations in `.claude/agents/` as Markdown files
- Test coverage focuses on integration testing through actual script execution
- Backup and recovery mechanisms for configuration files

#### Security Considerations
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data found
- Input validation present for JSON parsing
- File permissions properly set on executable scripts
- Backup files prevent data loss during updates

#### Patterns to Watch
- **Hook Syntax Limitations**: Remember hooks cannot use `/agent:` syntax directly
- **JSON Corruption Handling**: The invalid JSON recovery pattern is solid
- **Deduplication Logic**: Complex but necessary to prevent duplicate hook registration
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Uses `#\!/bin/sh` instead of bash for broader compatibility

#### Test Coverage Assessment
- Comprehensive test suite covering all major functionality
- Tests use realistic subprocess execution rather than mocks
- Edge cases well covered (invalid JSON, missing files, permission issues)
- All 7 test cases passing consistently

### PR #5: refactor: extract agent-manager functions to external scripts and add .gitignore

#### What I Learned
- Gadugi's agent-manager is evolving from embedded scripts in markdown to proper script architecture
- The project uses a download/execute pattern for script distribution from GitHub
- Test architecture improved significantly by moving from function extraction to direct script execution
- The .gitignore was missing and needed comprehensive coverage for Python and Claude Code artifacts

#### Architectural Evolution Observed
- **Script Extraction Pattern**: Moving from inline bash in markdown to external .sh files in scripts/ directory
- **Improved Testability**: Tests now execute scripts directly rather than extracting functions from markdown
- **Cleaner Separation**: agent-manager.md becomes pure documentation, scripts/ contains implementation
- **Command Line Interface**: New agent-manager.sh provides clean CLI for script operations

#### Security Patterns Discovered
- **Download/Execute Vulnerability**: Scripts downloaded from GitHub without integrity verification
- **Supply Chain Risk**: Hardcoded GitHub raw URLs pose security concerns if repository compromised
- **Shell Compatibility**: Mixed bash/sh usage could cause portability issues

#### Code Quality Improvements
- **Comprehensive .gitignore**: Properly excludes Python bytecode, Claude Code runtime files, IDE artifacts
- **Robust Error Handling**: JSON corruption recovery with backup creation
- **Hook Deduplication**: Complex but necessary logic to prevent duplicate hook registration
- **POSIX Considerations**: Scripts use appropriate shebangs for cross-platform compatibility

#### Patterns to Watch
- **Security First**: Always verify integrity of downloaded scripts before execution
- **Shell Consistency**: Standardize on either bash or sh throughout the codebase  
- **Test Evolution**: Direct script execution is much cleaner than function extraction
- **Gitignore Maintenance**: New comprehensive .gitignore needs ongoing maintenance

#### Test Coverage Assessment
- All 8 tests passing after refactoring (improved from 7 in previous PR)
- Test architecture significantly improved with direct script execution
- Missing: Network failure scenarios, integrity verification tests
- Excellent coverage of JSON handling, file operations, and hook setup

#### Follow-up Recommendations
- Address download/execute security vulnerability
- Standardize shell compatibility across all scripts
- Consider removing download pattern since scripts are now version controlled
- Add integration tests for network-dependent operations

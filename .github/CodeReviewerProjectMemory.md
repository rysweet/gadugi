### PR #154: feat: enhance CodeReviewer with design simplicity and over-engineering detection (Issue #104)

#### What I Learned
- The CodeReviewer agent architecture allows for extensible enhancement through new sections
- Design simplicity evaluation requires balancing multiple criteria: abstraction appropriateness, YAGNI compliance, cognitive load, and solution-problem fit
- Context-aware assessment is crucial - early-stage projects need different standards than mature systems
- Test-driven development of agent capabilities ensures reliability and prevents regressions
- Integration with existing review templates requires careful preservation of backward compatibility

#### Patterns to Watch
- Over-engineering pattern: Single-implementation abstractions (abstract classes with only one concrete implementation)
- YAGNI violations in configuration (options that exist "just in case" but are never actually configured)
- Complex inheritance hierarchies for simple behavioral variations
- Builder patterns applied to simple data structures
- Premature optimization without measurement

#### Architectural Decisions Noted
- The enhancement adds ~150 lines to the code-reviewer.md specification without breaking existing functionality
- Review template structure accommodates new "Design Simplicity Assessment" section seamlessly
- Priority system updated to include over-engineering as critical priority (affects team velocity)
- Comprehensive test coverage (22 tests) validates both detection accuracy and false positive avoidance
- Context-aware assessment prevents inappropriate complexity requirements for different project stages

# Archived Type Fix Scripts

This directory contains one-time fix scripts that were used during the type safety improvement effort (PR #312).

These scripts have been archived after successful application and are kept for historical reference only.

## Archived Scripts

- `fix_final_syntax.py` - Fixed final syntax errors in the codebase
- `final_orchestration.py` - Orchestrated the final type fixing pass

These scripts should not be run again as the fixes have already been applied to the codebase.

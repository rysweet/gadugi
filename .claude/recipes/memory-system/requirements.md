# Memory System Requirements

## Purpose and Goals

The Memory System provides intelligent context management and persistent memory storage for agents in the Gadugi v0.3 platform. It enables agents to maintain context across sessions, learn from past interactions, and share knowledge effectively.

## Functional Requirements

### Memory Storage
- Hierarchical memory organization (short-term, long-term, shared)
- Automatic memory consolidation and compression
- Semantic memory indexing for efficient retrieval
- Version control for memory updates
- Memory templates for common patterns

### Context Management
- Session context tracking and restoration
- Context switching between tasks
- Context inheritance for sub-tasks
- Context sharing between agents
- Context pruning based on relevance

### Memory Operations
- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations
- Batch memory operations for efficiency
- Memory search with semantic similarity
- Memory tagging and categorization
- Memory importance scoring

### Memory Types
- Episodic memories (specific events and interactions)
- Semantic memories (facts and knowledge)
- Procedural memories (how-to knowledge)
- Working memories (current task context)
- Shared memories (team knowledge base)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Sub-100ms memory retrieval for recent items
- Support for 1M+ memory items per agent
- Efficient compression (70%+ space savings)
- Lazy loading for large memory sets
- Background consolidation without blocking

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling across multiple storage nodes
- Partitioning by agent and time range
- Distributed caching for hot memories
- Automatic sharding for large datasets
- Cloud storage integration support

### Reliability
- ACID compliance for critical memories
- Automatic backup and recovery
- Memory corruption detection and repair
- Graceful degradation on storage failures
- Memory migration between versions

### Intelligence
- Automatic relevance scoring
- Forgetting curve implementation
- Pattern recognition in memories
- Memory association discovery
- Predictive memory pre-loading

## Interface Requirements

### Memory Manager Interface
```python
async def store(memory: Memory) -> MemoryId
async def retrieve(memory_id: MemoryId) -> Memory
async def search(query: str, limit: int) -> List[Memory]
async def update(memory_id: MemoryId, updates: Dict) -> bool
async def delete(memory_id: MemoryId) -> bool
```

### Context Manager Interface
```python
async def save_context(agent_id: str, context: Context) -> ContextId
async def load_context(agent_id: str) -> Context
async def switch_context(from_context: ContextId, to_context: ContextId)
async def merge_contexts(contexts: List[Context]) -> Context
```

### Memory Query Interface
```python
async def find_similar(memory: Memory, threshold: float) -> List[Memory]
async def find_by_tags(tags: List[str]) -> List[Memory]
async def find_by_timerange(start: datetime, end: datetime) -> List[Memory]
async def find_associations(memory_id: MemoryId) -> List[Memory]
```

## Quality Requirements

### Testing
- Unit tests for all memory operations
- Integration tests with Neo4j storage
- Performance benchmarks for retrieval
- Memory leak detection tests
- Corruption recovery tests

### Documentation
- Memory schema documentation
- API reference with examples
- Best practices guide
- Memory optimization guide
- Troubleshooting documentation

### Privacy and Security
- Memory encryption at rest
- Access control per memory item
- Audit trail for memory access
- PII detection and handling
- Memory sanitization options

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must integrate with Neo4j for graph storage
- Python 3.9+ required
- Maximum individual memory size: 10MB
- Memory retention: Configurable (default 90 days)
- Must support protobuf serialization

### Assumptions
- Agents have unique identifiers
- Time synchronization across system
- Storage is eventually consistent
- Network partitions are temporary
- Memory access patterns are read-heavy (80/20)

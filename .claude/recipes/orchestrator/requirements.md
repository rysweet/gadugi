# Orchestrator Requirements

## Purpose and Goals

The Orchestrator provides intelligent coordination of multiple agents and tasks in the Gadugi v0.3 platform. It enables parallel execution, dependency management, resource optimization, and workflow orchestration to achieve maximum efficiency and reliability.

## Functional Requirements

### Task Orchestration
- Parallel task execution for independent work
- Sequential execution for dependent tasks
- Mixed parallel-sequential workflows
- Dynamic task scheduling
- Task priority management

### Dependency Management
- Automatic dependency detection
- Dependency graph construction
- Circular dependency prevention
- Dynamic dependency resolution
- Dependency violation alerts

### Resource Management
- Resource allocation across agents
- Resource pooling and sharing
- Resource usage monitoring
- Resource conflict resolution
- Dynamic resource scaling

### Workflow Management
- Workflow definition and validation
- Workflow execution tracking
- Workflow state persistence
- Workflow branching and merging
- Workflow rollback capabilities

### Execution Strategies
- Breadth-first execution
- Depth-first execution
- Priority-based execution
- Resource-optimized execution
- Deadline-driven execution

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- 3-5x speedup for parallel tasks
- Sub-second task scheduling
- Minimal orchestration overhead (<5%)
- Support for 100+ concurrent tasks
- Real-time progress tracking

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of execution
- Distributed orchestration support
- Dynamic worker pool management
- Elastic resource allocation
- Cloud-native deployment

### Reliability
- Fault-tolerant execution
- Automatic failure recovery
- Checkpoint and restart
- Partial failure handling
- Transaction-like guarantees

### Observability
- Real-time execution monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Execution trace visualization
- Bottleneck identification
- Predictive analytics

## Interface Requirements

### Orchestrator Interface
```python
async def execute_workflow(workflow: Workflow) -> WorkflowResult
async def execute_parallel(tasks: List[Task]) -> List[TaskResult]
async def execute_sequential(tasks: List[Task]) -> List[TaskResult]
async def cancel_execution(execution_id: str) -> bool
async def get_execution_status(execution_id: str) -> ExecutionStatus
```

### Workflow Builder Interface
```python
def add_task(task: Task) -> WorkflowBuilder
def add_dependency(from_task: str, to_task: str) -> WorkflowBuilder
def set_parallelism(max_parallel: int) -> WorkflowBuilder
def set_timeout(timeout_seconds: int) -> WorkflowBuilder
def build() -> Workflow
```

### Resource Manager Interface
```python
async def allocate_resources(task: Task) -> ResourceAllocation
async def release_resources(allocation: ResourceAllocation) -> None
async def get_available_resources() -> ResourceInventory
async def reserve_resources(requirements: ResourceRequirements) -> ReservationId
```

## Quality Requirements

### Testing
- Unit tests for orchestration logic
- Integration tests for workflows
- Performance benchmarks
- Chaos engineering tests
- Load testing scenarios

### Documentation
- Orchestration patterns guide
- Workflow definition examples
- Performance tuning guide
- Troubleshooting documentation
- API reference

### Monitoring
- Execution metrics dashboard
- Resource utilization graphs
- Failure rate tracking
- Performance trending
- Alerting rules

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Maximum 1000 tasks per workflow
- Maximum execution time: 1 hour
- Python 3.9+ required
- Must integrate with agent framework
- Resource limits per execution

### Assumptions
- Tasks have defined resource requirements
- Network is generally reliable
- Agents are stateless or manage own state
- Storage is available for checkpoints
- Time synchronization across nodes

## Interface Requirements

### Coaching Interface
```python
async def analyze_performance(team_id: str) -> PerformanceReport
async def get_recommendations(team_id: str) -> List[Recommendation]
async def provide_feedback(agent_id: str, context: Context) -> Feedback
async def suggest_improvements(team_id: str) -> ImprovementPlan
async def predict_success(team_id: str, task: Task) -> SuccessPrediction
```

### Optimization Interface
```python
async def optimize_team_composition(requirements: TeamRequirements) -> Team
async def balance_workload(team: Team, tasks: List[Task]) -> WorkloadPlan
async def assign_roles(team: Team) -> RoleAssignment
async def route_task(task: Task, team: Team) -> Agent
async def form_subteams(team: Team, objectives: List[Objective]) -> List[Team]
```

### Analytics Interface
```python
async def get_team_metrics(team_id: str) -> TeamMetrics
async def analyze_collaboration(team_id: str) -> CollaborationAnalysis
async def detect_issues(team_id: str) -> List[Issue]
async def generate_report(team_id: str, period: TimePeriod) -> Report
async def track_progress(team_id: str, goals: List[Goal]) -> ProgressReport
```

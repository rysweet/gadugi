# Event System Requirements

## Purpose and Goals

The Event System provides asynchronous, event-driven communication between agents and services in the Gadugi v0.3 platform. It enables decoupled, scalable interactions through a publish-subscribe pattern with priority-based routing.

## Functional Requirements

### Event Publishing
- Agents must be able to publish events with defined schemas
- Events must include metadata (timestamp, source, priority, correlation ID)
- Support for synchronous and asynchronous publishing
- Batch event publishing for efficiency
- Event validation against protobuf schemas

### Event Subscription
- Agents can subscribe to specific event types or patterns
- Support for wildcard subscriptions (e.g., "agent.*")
- Dynamic subscription management (subscribe/unsubscribe at runtime)
- Subscription filtering based on event properties
- Persistent subscriptions that survive agent restarts

### Event Routing
- Priority-based event delivery (CRITICAL, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW)
- Dead letter queue for failed deliveries
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing subscribers
- Event replay capability for recovery scenarios
- Load balancing across multiple subscribers

### Event Types
- Agent lifecycle events (started, stopped, heartbeat)
- Task events (created, assigned, progress, completed, failed)
- System events (configuration changed, resource alerts)
- User interaction events (approval needed, question asked)
- Memory events (created, updated, pruned)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Handle 10,000+ events per second
- Sub-millisecond routing latency for high-priority events
- Support for 1,000+ concurrent subscribers
- Efficient memory usage with event pooling
- Minimal CPU overhead for event processing

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling through event partitioning
- Support for distributed event buses
- Auto-scaling based on queue depth
- Graceful degradation under load
- Backpressure handling

### Reliability
- At-least-once delivery guarantee
- Event ordering within partitions
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Event deduplication
- Persistent event storage for audit trail

### Observability
- Event metrics (throughput, latency, error rates)
- Distributed tracing support
- Event flow visualization
- Performance profiling hooks
- Debug mode with event inspection

## Interface Requirements

### Publisher Interface
```python
async def publish(event: Event) -> EventId
async def publish_batch(events: List[Event]) -> List[EventId]
def publish_sync(event: Event) -> EventId
```

### Subscriber Interface
```python
async def subscribe(pattern: str, handler: EventHandler) -> SubscriptionId
async def unsubscribe(subscription_id: SubscriptionId)
async def process_events() -> None
```

### Event Handler Interface
```python
async def handle(event: Event) -> HandlerResult
async def on_error(event: Event, error: Exception) -> ErrorAction
```

## Quality Requirements

### Testing
- Unit tests with 90%+ coverage
- Integration tests for event flow scenarios
- Load tests for performance validation
- Chaos testing for resilience
- Mock event generator for testing

### Documentation
- API documentation with examples
- Event schema documentation
- Performance tuning guide
- Troubleshooting guide
- Architecture diagrams

### Security
- Event encryption in transit
- Authentication for publishers/subscribers
- Authorization for event access
- Rate limiting per publisher
- Event sanitization

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must use protobuf for event serialization
- Python 3.9+ required
- Must integrate with existing Neo4j database
- Maximum event size: 1MB
- Event retention: 30 days

### Assumptions
- Network is generally reliable (< 1% packet loss)
- Agents handle their own state persistence
- Time synchronization across nodes (NTP)
- Docker/Kubernetes deployment environment
- Redis available for high-performance caching

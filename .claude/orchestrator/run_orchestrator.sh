Orchestrator Agent Entry Point Script

This script serves as the entry point for Claude agent invocations of the format:
/agent:orchestrator-agent

It bridges the gap between Claude's agent invocation system and the Python
orchestrator implementation, enabling actual parallel execution.

Usage:
  ./run_orchestrator.sh                    # Interactive mode
  ./run_orchestrator.sh --stdin            # Agent invocation mode (reads from stdin)
  ./run_orchestrator.sh file1.md file2.md  # Direct file specification

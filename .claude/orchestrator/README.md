# OrchestratorAgent - Parallel Workflow Execution System

The OrchestratorAgent is a sophisticated coordination system that enables parallel execution of multiple WorkflowManagers, achieving 3-5x faster development workflows through intelligent task analysis and git worktree management.

## Overview

Traditional sequential workflow execution creates significant inefficiencies when multiple independent tasks could run simultaneously. The OrchestratorAgent solves this by:

- **Analyzing task dependencies** to identify parallelizable work
- **Creating isolated environments** using git worktrees
- **Orchestrating multiple Claude CLI instances** running in parallel
- **Managing system resources** and monitoring execution progress
- **Coordinating results** and handling merge conflicts intelligently

## Architecture

```
OrchestratorAgent
├── TaskAnalyzer          # Prompt parsing and dependency detection
├── WorktreeManager       # Git worktree lifecycle management
├── ExecutionEngine       # Parallel process execution
├── ResourceMonitor       # System resource monitoring
└── IntegrationManager    # Result coordination and merging
```

## Core Components

### 1. TaskAnalyzer (`components/task_analyzer.py`)

**Purpose**: Intelligent analysis of prompt files and task dependencies

**Key Features**:
- Parses all prompt files in `/prompts/` directory
- Classifies tasks by type (test coverage, bug fix, feature, etc.)
- Detects file modification conflicts between tasks
- Analyzes Python import dependencies
- Estimates resource requirements and execution time
- Generates optimal execution plans with parallelization strategies

**Usage**:
```python
from task_analyzer import TaskAnalyzer

analyzer = TaskAnalyzer(prompts_dir="/prompts/")
tasks = analyzer.analyze_all_prompts()
execution_plan = analyzer.generate_execution_plan()

print(f"Speed improvement: {execution_plan['speed_improvement']}x")
print(f"Parallelizable tasks: {execution_plan['parallelizable_tasks']}")
```

### 2. WorktreeManager (`components/worktree_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Isolated environment creation and management using git worktrees

**Key Features**:
- Creates isolated git worktrees for each parallel task
- Manages unique feature branches with consistent naming
- Handles environment synchronization and cleanup
- Preserves state across interruptions
- Validates worktree integrity and detects issues

**Usage**:
```python
from worktree_manager import WorktreeManager

manager = WorktreeManager()
worktree = manager.create_worktree("task-123", "Test Coverage Task")
print(f"Created worktree at: {worktree.worktree_path}")

# Later cleanup
manager.cleanup_worktree("task-123")
```

### 3. ExecutionEngine (`components/execution_engine.py`)

**Purpose**: Parallel process spawning and monitoring with resource management

**Key Features**:
- Spawns multiple Claude CLI instances for concurrent execution
- Monitors system resources and adjusts concurrency dynamically
- Tracks real-time progress via JSON output parsing
- Handles timeouts, cancellations, and error isolation
- Generates comprehensive execution reports and metrics

**Usage**:
```python
from execution_engine import ExecutionEngine

engine = ExecutionEngine(max_concurrent=4)
results = engine.execute_tasks_parallel(tasks, worktree_manager)

for task_id, result in results.items():
    print(f"Task {task_id}: {result.status} ({result.duration}s)")
```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Claude CLI**: Install and configure Claude Code CLI
   ```bash
   # Ensure Claude CLI is available
   which claude
   ```

2. **Git**: Git 2.25+ with worktree support
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

3. **Python Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   pip install psutil  # For system resource monitoring
   ```

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the OrchestratorAgent directory:
   ```bash
   cd .claude/orchestrator
   ```

2. **Run the test suite** to verify installation:
   ```bash
   cd tests && python run_tests.py
   ```

3. **Analyze your prompts** for parallel opportunities:
   ```bash
   python components/task_analyzer.py --prompts-dir /path/to/prompts --output analysis.json
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Parallel Test Coverage Improvement

```bash
# Analyze prompts for test coverage tasks
cd .claude/orchestrator
python components/task_analyzer.py --prompts-dir ../../../prompts/

# The analyzer identifies these parallelizable tasks:
# - test-definition-node.md (32.09% → 80% coverage)
# - test-relationship-creator.md (32.50% → 80% coverage)  
# - test-documentation-linker.md (15.65% → 80% coverage)

# Expected result: 3x speed improvement (180 minutes → 60 minutes)
```

### Example 2: Independent Bug Fixes

```bash
# Multiple unrelated bug fixes that can run in parallel:
# - fix-circular-import.md (lsp_helper.py)
# - fix-memory-leak.md (graph.py)
# - fix-ui-rendering.md (frontend files)

# No file conflicts detected → Full parallelization possible
# Expected result: 3x speed improvement
```

### Example 3: Mixed Workflow with Dependencies

```bash
# Smart scheduling handles dependencies automatically:
# - Phase 1: Parallel tasks (A, B, C) 
# - Phase 2: Sequential task D (depends on A)
# - Phase 3: Parallel tasks (E, F) (depend on D)

# Expected result: 2x speed improvement with dependency respect
```

## Advanced Configuration

### System Resource Management

The ExecutionEngine automatically monitors system resources and adjusts concurrency:

```python
# Default concurrency calculation
cpu_based = max(1, cpu_count - 1)      # Leave one core free
memory_based = max(1, available_gb / 2) # 2GB per task
optimal_concurrency = min(cpu_based, memory_based, 4)  # Cap at 4
```

### Custom Task Classification

Extend the TaskAnalyzer with custom classification rules:

```python
class CustomTaskAnalyzer(TaskAnalyzer):
    def _classify_task_type(self, content, name):
        # Add custom classification logic
        if 'database migration' in content.lower():
            return TaskType.CONFIGURATION
        return super()._classify_task_type(content, name)
```

### Worktree Configuration

Customize worktree behavior:

```python
manager = WorktreeManager(
    project_root="/path/to/project",
    worktrees_dir=".parallel-tasks",  # Custom directory
)

# Override branch naming convention
def custom_branch_name(task_id, task_name):
    return f"parallel/{task_id}-{task_name.lower().replace(' ', '-')}"
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Test Coverage Scenario
- **Sequential execution**: 180 minutes (3 test coverage tasks × 60 minutes each)
- **Parallel execution**: 60 minutes (longest task duration)
- **Speed improvement**: 3.0x

### Mixed Workload Scenario  
- **Sequential execution**: 240 minutes (8 tasks with varying complexity)
- **Parallel execution**: 90 minutes (3 parallel phases)
- **Speed improvement**: 2.7x

### Resource Utilization
- **CPU usage**: Optimally utilizes available cores while maintaining system responsiveness
- **Memory usage**: Scales based on available RAM (2GB per concurrent task)
- **Disk I/O**: Minimized through worktree isolation and cleanup

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Graceful Degradation
- **High CPU usage (>90%)**: Automatically reduces concurrent tasks
- **Low memory (<1GB available)**: Switches to sequential execution
- **Disk space issues**: Cleans up temporary files and reduces parallelism

### Failure Isolation
- **Task failures**: Failed tasks don't affect others, detailed error reporting provided
- **Process crashes**: Automatic restart with exponential backoff
- **Git conflicts**: Isolated to specific worktrees, resolution guidance provided

### State Recovery
- **Interruption handling**: State preserved in `.claude/orchestrator/worktree_state.json`
- **Resume capability**: Can resume from last successful checkpoint
- **Cleanup automation**: Automatic cleanup of failed or interrupted tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Claude CLI not found"
```bash
# Solution: Ensure Claude CLI is installed and in PATH
which claude
# If not found, install Claude Code CLI
```

**Issue**: "Git worktree operation failed"
```bash
# Solution: Check git version and repository state
git --version  # Requires 2.25+
git status     # Ensure clean working directory
```

**Issue**: "High memory usage during parallel execution"
```bash
# Solution: The system automatically reduces concurrency
# Monitor with: ps aux | grep claude
# Or set lower max_concurrent manually
```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# All components will now provide detailed debug information
```

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor execution in real-time:

```python
def progress_callback(completed, total, result):
    print(f"Progress: {completed}/{total} - {result.task_id}: {result.status}")
    if result.status == 'failed':
        print(f"Error: {result.error_message}")

engine.execute_tasks_parallel(tasks, manager, progress_callback)
```

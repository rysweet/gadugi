```

## Phase 2: Branch Creation

```bash
# Assuming issue #N was created
git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]-N
```

## Phase 3: Research and Planning

1. Analyze affected modules:

## Phase 4: Implementation

Break into focused commits:
1. First component
2. Second component
3. Integration
4. Edge cases

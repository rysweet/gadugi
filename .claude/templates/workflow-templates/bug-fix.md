```

## Phase 2: Branch Creation

```bash
# Assuming issue #N was created
git checkout -b fix/[bug-description]-N
```

## Phase 3: Research and Diagnosis

1. Reproduce the bug:

    # Setup conditions that caused bug
    # Verify it now works correctly
    # Test edge cases
```

## Phase 6: Documentation

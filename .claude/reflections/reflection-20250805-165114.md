## Learning Insights
### What Worked Well
- Steady development progress maintained
- No infinite loops detected in reflection system
- Successfully migrated from hook-based to phase-based reflection

### Areas for Improvement
- Consider implementing automated test coverage reporting
- Explore automated code quality metrics collection
- Investigate performance baseline establishment

### Patterns Identified
- Reflection data collection is more reliable without hooks
- Workflow-integrated reflection provides better context
- Safe reflection prevents cascade failures

### Technical Discoveries
- Hook-based reflection caused infinite loops
- Phase-based reflection is more controlled and reliable
- Data collection can be decoupled from real-time execution

## Recommendations
### Process Improvements
- Continue using phase-based reflection approach
- Implement scheduled reflection analysis
- Add reflection data to CI/CD pipeline

### Tool Enhancements
- Develop reflection dashboard for visualization
- Create automated improvement issue generation
- Integrate with project management tools

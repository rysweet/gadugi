# CodeReviewResponseAgent Test Scenario

## Test Review Feedback

This test simulates a code review with various types of feedback to validate the CodeReviewResponseAgent.

### Critical Issues üö®
1. **security_utils.py:23**: Password stored in plain text
   - **Rationale**: Major security vulnerability
   - **Suggestion**: Use bcrypt or argon2 for password hashing

### Important Improvements üîß
2. **database_helper.py:45**: Connection not closed in error path
   - **Rationale**: Resource leak on exceptions
   - **Suggestion**: Use try-finally or context manager

3. **api_handler.py:89**: Missing input validation
   - **Rationale**: Could cause crashes with invalid data
   - **Suggestion**: Add validation before processing

### Good Suggestions üí°
4. **data_processor.py:156**: Consider caching frequently accessed data
   - **Rationale**: Same data fetched multiple times
   - **Suggestion**: Implement simple LRU cache

### Questions ‚ùì
5. **config_manager.py:78**: Why load config on every request?
   - Wouldn't it be better to load once at startup?

### Minor Points üìù
6. **test_utils.py:34**: Typo in comment "retrun" should be "return"
7. **models.py:67**: Extra blank line (style preference)

## Expected Agent Behavior

### For Critical Issue #1
- Implement password hashing immediately
- Add test for password security
- Thank reviewer for security catch

### For Important Issues #2-3
- Fix connection leak with context manager
- Add input validation with clear error messages
- Include tests for both fixes

### For Suggestion #4
- Evaluate caching benefit
- Either implement with justification
- Or explain why not needed currently

### For Question #5
- Explain config reloading allows runtime updates
- Mention performance trade-off considered
- Offer to add caching if needed

### For Minor Points #6-7
- Fix typo
- May or may not fix extra blank line
- Acknowledge feedback regardless

## Validation Criteria

‚úÖ All 7 feedback points addressed
‚úÖ Critical security issue fixed first
‚úÖ Professional tone in all responses
‚úÖ Clear explanations for decisions
‚úÖ Tests added for bug fixes
‚úÖ AI agent attribution included

## Test Execution

To test the agent:
1. Create a mock PR with above feedback
2. Invoke: `/agent:code-review-response`
3. Verify all expected behaviors
4. Check response quality and tone
5. Ensure changes are correct

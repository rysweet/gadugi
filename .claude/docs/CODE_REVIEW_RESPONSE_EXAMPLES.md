## Example 1: Security Vulnerability

### Review Feedback
```
Critical Issue üö®
- auth_handler.py:45: SQL injection vulnerability - User input is directly concatenated into query
  - Rationale: This allows malicious SQL execution
  - Suggestion: Use parameterized queries
```

### Agent Response
```markdown
Excellent catch! I've fixed the security vulnerability by replacing string concatenation with parameterized queries:

```python
# Before (vulnerable):
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# After (secure):
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

I've also:
- Added input validation
- Created a test case to verify SQL injection protection
- Audited similar queries in the codebase (all others were already safe)

Thank you for keeping our code secure!

## Example 2: Performance Optimization

### Review Feedback
```
Performance Notes ‚ö°
- data_processor.py:102: This nested loop creates O(n¬≤) complexity
  - Rationale: Will be slow for large datasets
  - Suggestion: Use a hash map for O(n) lookup
```

### Agent Response
```markdown
Good point about performance. I've optimized by using a dictionary for O(1) lookups:

```python
# Before: O(n¬≤)
for item in items:
    for ref in references:
        if item.id == ref.item_id:
            item.ref = ref

# After: O(n)
ref_map = {ref.item_id: ref for ref in references}
for item in items:
    item.ref = ref_map.get(item.id)
```

Performance improvement:
- 1,000 items: 45ms ‚Üí 2ms (22x faster)
- 10,000 items: 4,500ms ‚Üí 15ms (300x faster)

Added performance test to verify the optimization.

## Example 3: Design Question

### Review Feedback
```
Questions ‚ùì
- Why use a factory pattern here instead of direct instantiation?
- Would a simpler approach work?
```

### Agent Response
```markdown
Thank you for this question. I chose the factory pattern here for several reasons:

1. **Multiple Node Types**: We have 8 different node types (FileNode, ClassNode, FunctionNode, etc.) that share common interfaces but have different initialization requirements.

2. **Configuration-Based Creation**: The node type is determined at runtime from parsed AST data, making direct instantiation impractical:
   ```python
   # Direct instantiation would require:
   if node_type == "class":
       node = ClassNode(name, path, level, methods)
   elif node_type == "function":
       node = FunctionNode(name, path, level, params, returns)
   # ... 6 more conditions
   
   # Factory pattern:
   node = NodeFactory.create(node_type, **node_data)
   ```

3. **Future Extensibility**: New node types can be added without modifying existing code, following the Open/Closed Principle.

4. **Consistent Validation**: The factory ensures all nodes are properly validated before creation.

A simpler approach would work for 2-3 node types, but would become unwieldy with our current 8 types and planned additions.

Happy to discuss alternative patterns if you see a cleaner approach!

## Example 4: Respectful Disagreement

### Review Feedback
```
Improvements üí°
- utils.py:78: Consider using regex instead of multiple string operations
  - Rationale: More concise and potentially faster
  - Suggestion: Replace with regex pattern
```

### Agent Response
```markdown
I appreciate your suggestion about using regex. I've carefully considered it, and I'd like to explain why I've kept the current string operations approach:

1. **Readability**: The current approach is more explicit about what's happening:
   ```python
   # Current approach (clear intent):
   result = text.strip()
   result = result.replace('\t', ' ')
   result = result.replace('  ', ' ')
   
   # Regex approach (requires regex knowledge):
   result = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text.strip())
   ```

2. **Performance**: For our typical input sizes (< 1KB), benchmarking shows:
   - String operations: 0.8Œºs average
   - Regex: 2.1Œºs average (due to compilation overhead)

3. **Maintainability**: Team members have varying regex expertise, and this code is in a frequently-modified module.

4. **Debugging**: String operations are easier to step through during debugging.

That said, if we start processing larger texts or need more complex transformations, regex would definitely be the better choice. Your input is valuable and helps me think through these trade-offs!

## Example 5: Scope Creep

### Review Feedback
```
Suggestions üí°
- While you're updating the logger, could you also add:
  - Log rotation
  - Remote logging support
  - Performance metrics logging
  - Custom log formats
```

### Agent Response
```markdown
This is an excellent suggestion that would significantly improve our logging infrastructure! Since these enhancements extend beyond the current PR's scope (fixing the log level configuration), I've created issue #127 to track this enhancement.

The current PR focuses on fixing the immediate bug where log levels weren't being respected. The improvements you've suggested would be perfect for a dedicated logging enhancement PR where we can:
- Design the log rotation strategy
- Evaluate remote logging services
- Define performance metrics to track
- Create flexible formatting system

I've added you as a reviewer on the new issue. Thank you for thinking about the bigger picture ‚Äì these improvements will make our logging much more robust!

## Example 6: Multiple Reviewers with Conflicting Feedback

### Review Feedback
```
Reviewer 1: "Use async/await for better performance"
Reviewer 2: "Keep it synchronous for simplicity"
```

### Agent Response
```markdown
Thank you both for your feedback. You've raised an important architectural decision about async vs. sync operations.

After analyzing the specific use case:
- This function is called avg. 10 times/minute
- Each call completes in ~50ms
- No I/O operations that would benefit from async

I'm keeping the synchronous approach for now because:
1. **Simplicity**: Easier to understand and debug
2. **No Performance Benefit**: CPU-bound operation won't improve with async
3. **Integration**: All callers are currently synchronous

However, I've structured the code to make it easy to convert to async if our usage patterns change (e.g., if we need concurrent processing).

I appreciate both perspectives ‚Äì they helped me think through this decision more thoroughly!

## Example 7: Minor Style Feedback

### Review Feedback
```
Minor: Variable name 'calc_result' could be more descriptive
```

### Agent Response
```markdown
Good point! I've renamed `calc_result` to `monthly_revenue_total` to better reflect what it represents. 

Also updated the related test to use the new name. Thanks for helping improve code clarity!

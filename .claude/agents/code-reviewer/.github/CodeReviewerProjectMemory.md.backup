## Code Review Memory - 2025-08-29

### Commit f37e1e3: Comprehensive Memory Fallback System

#### What I Learned
- The project implements a sophisticated 4-tier memory fallback chain (Neo4j → SQLite → Markdown → In-Memory)
- Each backend implements the same MemoryBackend interface for transparent switching
- The system includes automatic health monitoring with configurable intervals
- Memory data models support various types (short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic, procedural)
- The fallback chain attempts to sync data back to higher-priority backends when they recover

#### Patterns to Watch
- Extensive use of dataclasses with proper serialization/deserialization methods
- Async/await patterns throughout for non-blocking I/O operations
- Graceful degradation with comprehensive error handling
- Human-readable markdown storage format for debugging/recovery
- Clear separation between backend implementations and fallback logic

#### Architecture Insights
- Clean abstraction via MemoryBackend base class
- Each backend handles its own connection management
- Health monitoring runs independently and emits events
- SQLite backend uses proper indexes for performance
- Markdown backend organizes by agent_id and memory type


### Security Findings
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries confirmed
- Path traversal prevention through Path object usage
- Credential management needs production hardening

### Performance Observations
- Proper indexing strategy in SQLite backend
- Async I/O prevents blocking operations
- Connection pooling missing - potential bottleneck
- Tag searches use O(n) algorithm - needs optimization for scale

### Testing Insights
- 2,000+ lines of test coverage shows commitment to quality
- Test structure follows AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Missing stress tests for concurrent access patterns

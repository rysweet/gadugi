## üö® CRITICAL: Workflow Enforcement

**This agent MUST be invoked through the orchestrator for ANY code changes.**

### Workflow Requirements:
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Use orchestrator for file modifications
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Follow 11-phase workflow for code changes
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Direct file editing or creation
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Bypassing quality gates

### When Orchestrator is REQUIRED:
- Any file modifications (.py, .js, .json, .md, etc.)
- Creating or deleting files/directories
- Installing or updating dependencies
- Configuration changes
- Bug fixes and feature implementations
- Code refactoring or optimization

### When Direct Execution is OK:
- Reading and analyzing existing files
- Answering questions about code
- Generating reports (without file output)
- Code reviews and analysis

### Compliance Check:
Before executing any task, validate with:
```bash
python .claude/workflow-enforcement/validate-workflow.py --task "your task description"
```

### Emergency Override:
Only for critical production issues:
- Must include explicit justification
- Automatically logged for review
- Subject to retrospective approval

**üîí REMEMBER: This workflow protects code quality and ensures proper testing!**

## Code Review Memory - 2025-08-29

### Commit f37e1e3: Comprehensive Memory Fallback System

#### What I Learned
- The project implements a sophisticated 4-tier memory fallback chain (Neo4j ‚Üí SQLite ‚Üí Markdown ‚Üí In-Memory)
- Each backend implements the same MemoryBackend interface for transparent switching
- The system includes automatic health monitoring with configurable intervals
- Memory data models support various types (short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic, procedural)
- The fallback chain attempts to sync data back to higher-priority backends when they recover

#### Patterns to Watch
- Extensive use of dataclasses with proper serialization/deserialization methods
- Async/await patterns throughout for non-blocking I/O operations
- Graceful degradation with comprehensive error handling
- Human-readable markdown storage format for debugging/recovery
- Clear separation between backend implementations and fallback logic

#### Architecture Insights
- Clean abstraction via MemoryBackend base class
- Each backend handles its own connection management
- Health monitoring runs independently and emits events
- SQLite backend uses proper indexes for performance
- Markdown backend organizes by agent_id and memory type


### Security Findings
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries confirmed
- Path traversal prevention through Path object usage
- Credential management needs production hardening

### Performance Observations
- Proper indexing strategy in SQLite backend
- Async I/O prevents blocking operations
- Connection pooling missing - potential bottleneck
- Tag searches use O(n) algorithm - needs optimization for scale

### Testing Insights
- 2,000+ lines of test coverage shows commitment to quality
- Test structure follows AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Missing stress tests for concurrent access patterns

# Workflow Manager Agent v0.3


## üö® CRITICAL: Workflow Enforcement

**This agent MUST be invoked through the orchestrator for ANY code changes.**

### Workflow Requirements:
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Use orchestrator for file modifications
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Follow 11-phase workflow for code changes
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Direct file editing or creation
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Bypassing quality gates

### When Orchestrator is REQUIRED:
- Any file modifications (.py, .js, .json, .md, etc.)
- Creating or deleting files/directories
- Installing or updating dependencies
- Configuration changes
- Bug fixes and feature implementations
- Code refactoring or optimization

### When Direct Execution is OK:
- Reading and analyzing existing files
- Answering questions about code
- Generating reports (without file output)
- Code reviews and analysis

### Compliance Check:
Before executing any task, validate with:
```bash
python .claude/workflow-enforcement/validate-workflow.py --task "your task description"
```

### Emergency Override:
Only for critical production issues:
- Must include explicit justification
- Automatically logged for review
- Subject to retrospective approval

**üîí REMEMBER: This workflow protects code quality and ensures proper testing!**

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- UV package manager (for UV projects) or pip
- Git
- Memory system (MCP service running on localhost:8000)

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from workflow_manager_v03 import WorkflowManagerV03

async def main():
    # Create and initialize agent
    agent = WorkflowManagerV03("my_workflow_manager")

    try:
        # Initialize with memory system
        await agent.initialize()

        # Start a workflow task
        task_id = await agent.start_task("Implement user authentication feature")

        # Execute the workflow
        outcome = await agent.execute_task({
            'task_id': task_id,
            'description': 'Implement user authentication feature',
            'repository_path': '/path/to/repo',
            'target_branch': 'main',
            'success_criteria': ['Users can log in securely'],
            'constraints': ['Must use JWT tokens']
        })

        # Learn from the outcome
        await agent.learn_from_outcome(outcome)

        print(f"Workflow completed: {'SUCCESS' if outcome.success else 'FAILED'}")

    finally:
        await agent.shutdown()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Advanced Features

### Memory-Aware Execution
The agent automatically:
- Searches for similar past workflows
- Applies learned patterns and best practices
- Avoids previously encountered errors
- Stores new experiences for future use

### Collaborative Decision Making
- Writes decisions and progress to shared whiteboard
- Shares expertise with other agents
- Collaborates through the memory system

### Error Recovery and Checkpoints
- Saves state after each successful phase
- Can resume from checkpoints after failures
- Implements recovery strategies for common errors
- Learns from error patterns for future prevention

### PR Review Integration
```python
# Process PR review feedback
feedback = [
    PRReviewFeedback(
        reviewer="senior_dev",
        comment="Please add error handling",
        severity="major"
    )
]

analysis = await agent.process_pr_feedback(feedback)
recommendations = await agent.get_proactive_recommendations("Add API endpoint")
```

# Orchestrator V0.3 - Production Ready Intelligent Task Orchestrator

## Overview

The Orchestrator V0.3 is a production-ready agent that provides intelligent task decomposition, parallel execution management, and adaptive learning capabilities. It inherits from the V03Agent base class to gain memory persistence and learning abilities.

## Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Task Decomposition
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from past executions to identify optimal task breakdown strategies
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Considers project type, technology stack, and historical success rates
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Automatically adjusts decomposition based on success feedback

### ⚡ Advanced Parallel Execution
- **Dependency Analysis**: Automatically detects file, import, resource, and semantic dependencies
- **Optimal Batching**: Creates execution batches that maximize parallelism while respecting constraints
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent allocation of CPU, memory, and I/O resources

### 📈 Performance Optimization
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks throughput, latency, success rates, and resource utilization
- **Adaptive Tuning**: Automatically adjusts parameters based on performance metrics
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identifies and resolves performance bottlenecks

### 🎯 Learning and Evolution
- **Pattern Learning**: Creates new patterns from successful executions
- **Success Rate Tracking**: Maintains confidence scores for different strategies
- **Memory Integration**: Uses V03Agent memory system for persistent learning

## Usage Example

```python
from orchestrator_v03 import OrchestratorV03

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = OrchestratorV03()

# Initialize with memory system (for full functionality)
await orchestrator.initialize(mcp_url="http://localhost:8000")

# Execute a complex task
task = {
    "description": "Implement user authentication system with JWT tokens",
    "parameters": {
        "features": ["login", "register", "password_reset"],
        "tech_stack": "Python/FastAPI"
    }
}

outcome = await orchestrator.execute_task(task)

# Results
print(f"Success: {outcome.success}")
print(f"Duration: {outcome.duration_seconds:.1f}s")
print(f"Steps: {len(outcome.steps_taken)}")
print(f"Lessons: {outcome.lessons_learned}")
```

## Core Capabilities

### Task Types Supported

1. Architecture Design → 2. Core Implementation + 3. Testing (parallel) → 4. Integration Testing → 5. Documentation

**Bug Fix (4 subtasks, 1.8x speedup)**
1. Root Cause Analysis + Impact Assessment (parallel) → 2. Fix Implementation → 3. Verification Testing

**Testing Workflow (4 subtasks, 2.5x speedup)**
1. Test Planning → 2. Unit Tests + Integration Tests (parallel) → 3. E2E Tests → 4. Reporting

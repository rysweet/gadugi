# Parallelization Patterns

## Task Decomposition Strategies

### Independent Task Pattern
When tasks have no dependencies, execute all in parallel:
- File processing across different directories
- Independent test suites
- Multiple documentation updates
- Separate feature implementations

**Speedup**: Linear with number of workers (up to ~10x)

### Pipeline Pattern
Tasks with sequential dependencies:
```
Stage 1: [Task A, Task B] (parallel)
Stage 2: [Task C] (depends on A,B)
Stage 3: [Task D, Task E] (parallel, depends on C)
```

**Speedup**: 2-3x typical

### Map-Reduce Pattern
1. Map: Split large task into chunks
2. Process: Each chunk in parallel
3. Reduce: Combine results

**Use for**:
- Large file transformations
- Database migrations
- Code analysis across modules

### Fork-Join Pattern
1. Fork: Create parallel subtasks
2. Execute: Run subtasks concurrently
3. Join: Wait for all to complete
4. Merge: Combine results

**Best for**:
- Test execution
- Multi-module builds
- Batch operations

## Optimization Strategies

### Task Sizing
- Sweet spot: 30 seconds - 5 minutes per task
- Too small: Overhead dominates
- Too large: Poor load balancing

### Resource Allocation
- CPU-bound: Limit to CPU cores
- I/O-bound: Can exceed CPU count (2-3x)
- Memory-bound: Monitor and limit

### Dependency Analysis
- Build dependency graph first
- Find critical path
- Optimize critical path tasks first

## Common Parallelization Opportunities

### In Development Workflows
1. **Testing**: Run test suites in parallel
2. **Linting**: Check different directories simultaneously
3. **Building**: Compile independent modules
4. **Documentation**: Generate docs for multiple components
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to multiple environments

### In Code Changes
1. **Refactoring**: Update multiple files independently
2. **Adding features**: Implement non-conflicting features
3. **Bug fixes**: Fix independent issues
4. **Updates**: Update dependencies in parallel

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Race Conditions
- Writing to same file from multiple tasks
- Modifying shared state without locks
- Database writes without transactions

### Resource Exhaustion
- Too many parallel tasks
- Not considering memory limits
- Ignoring I/O bottlenecks

### Poor Task Division
- Uneven task sizes
- Too fine granularity
- Ignoring locality of reference

## Performance Metrics

### Key Indicators
- Speedup = Sequential Time / Parallel Time
- Efficiency = Speedup / Number of Workers
- Utilization = Busy Time / Total Time

### Target Metrics
- Efficiency > 70% is good
- Utilization > 80% is good
- Speedup should be > 2x to justify complexity

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Type Error Fixes
```python
tasks = [
    "Fix errors in /src",
    "Fix errors in /tests",
    "Fix errors in /docs"
]
# Can run all 3 in parallel
```

### Example 2: Feature Implementation
```python
Stage 1: [
    "Create database schema",
    "Design API interface"
] # Parallel

Stage 2: [
    "Implement API endpoints"
] # Sequential, depends on Stage 1

Stage 3: [
    "Add tests",
    "Write documentation"
] # Parallel
```

## Memory Considerations
- Each parallel task uses memory
- Python processes: ~50-100MB base
- Add data size per task
- Formula: Max_Parallel = Available_RAM / (Base + Data_Per_Task)

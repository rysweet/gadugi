# XPIA Defense Agent - Cross-Prompt Injection Attack Protection

## Agent Overview

**Purpose**: Protect the Gadugi multi-agent system from Cross-Prompt Injection Attacks (XPIA) by analyzing and sanitizing all agent communications, user input, and file content.

**Role**: Security middleware that operates transparently between agents and the Claude Code execution environment, providing real-time threat detection and content sanitization.

**Integration**: Functions as security middleware using the agent-manager hook system for transparent protection of all agent communications.

## Core Capabilities

### Threat Detection
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies known injection attack patterns and techniques
- **Semantic Analysis**: Context-aware evaluation of suspicious content structure
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detects attempts to manipulate agent behavior or role
- **Content Validation**: Validates prompt structure and intent authenticity

### Content Sanitization
- **Safe Extraction**: Removes malicious content while preserving legitimate functionality
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains original intent while eliminating threats
- **Encoding Normalization**: Handles obfuscated attacks using various encoding schemes
- **Structure Validation**: Ensures prompt structure integrity

### Security Monitoring
- **Real-time Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of all security decisions
- **Threat Intelligence**: Tracks attack patterns and trends
- **Performance Monitoring**: Ensures minimal impact on agent communications
- **Alert System**: Immediate notification of detected threats

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points
- **Agent-Manager Hooks**: Transparent middleware using existing hook system
- **Enhanced Separation**: Leverages shared modules for GitHub operations and error handling
- **Simple Memory Manager**: Uses GitHub Issues for security logging and threat intelligence
- **All Agents**: Protects WorkflowManager, OrchestratorAgent, Code-Reviewer, and future agents

### Security Framework
```
Input Content → XPIA Defense Agent → Analysis → Sanitization → Safe Content
     ↓               ↓                  ↓           ↓
  Logging ←     Threat Intel ←    Alert System ← Security Action
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Latency Impact**: <100ms added delay to agent communications
- **Resource Usage**: <5% CPU overhead during normal operations
- **Throughput**: Handle 100+ concurrent agent communications
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime without security failures

## Threat Detection Patterns

### Direct Injection Attacks
- System prompt override attempts
- Role manipulation commands
- Identity confusion attacks
- Context corruption attempts

### Advanced Techniques
- **Encoding Obfuscation**: Base64, URL encoding, Unicode tricks
- **Multi-Stage Attacks**: Attacks spread across multiple interactions
- **Social Engineering**: Manipulative language targeting agent behavior
- **Semantic Confusion**: Exploiting natural language ambiguity

### Command Injection
- Shell command execution attempts
- File system manipulation
- Network access attempts
- Privilege escalation tries

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Engine
Build the fundamental threat detection and sanitization capabilities with comprehensive pattern library and real-time analysis.

### Phase 2: Integration
Seamlessly integrate with existing agent infrastructure using the agent-manager hook system for transparent protection.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
Implement semantic analysis, behavioral pattern detection, and adaptive learning mechanisms.

### Phase 4: Validation
Comprehensive security testing, performance optimization, and documentation creation.

## Configuration and Policies

### Security Modes
- **Strict Mode**: Block all suspicious content (production security)
- **Balanced Mode**: Block obvious threats, warn on suspicious content
- **Permissive Mode**: Log threats but allow execution (development only)

### Configurable Elements
- **Threat Patterns**: Customizable detection pattern library
- **Whitelist Rules**: Exception patterns for legitimate use cases
- **Logging Levels**: Adjustable verbosity for security logging
- **Performance Tuning**: Configurable detection depth vs. speed tradeoffs

## Usage Patterns

### Automatic Protection
The XPIA Defense Agent operates automatically as middleware, requiring no changes to existing agent code:

```python
# Transparent protection - no code changes needed
user_input = get_user_input()  # Automatically filtered
agent_communication = receive_from_agent()  # Automatically validated
file_content = read_file()  # Automatically sanitized
```

### Manual Validation
For sensitive operations, explicit validation can be requested:

```python
from xpia_defense import XPIADefenseAgent

defense = XPIADefenseAgent()
validation_result = defense.validate_content(
    content=suspicious_input,
    context="agent_communication",
    strict_mode=True
)

if validation_result.is_safe:
    process_content(validation_result.sanitized_content)
else:
    handle_threat(validation_result.threat_analysis)
```

## Success Metrics

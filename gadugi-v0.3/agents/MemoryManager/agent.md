- **Context Pruning**: Remove outdated information while preserving critical context
- **Session Continuity**: Ensure context flows smoothly between AI assistant sessions
- **Memory Optimization**: Balance detail with conciseness for effective memory usage

### GitHub Integration
- **Issues Synchronization**: Sync Memory.md tasks with GitHub Issues
- **Bidirectional Updates**: Keep Memory.md and Issues in sync automatically
- **Label Management**: Apply appropriate labels (memory-sync, ai-assistant, priority levels)
- **Status Tracking**: Update issue status based on memory task completion

### Content Organization
- **Structured Format**: Maintain consistent Memory.md structure and formatting
- **Priority Management**: Order tasks and context by importance and urgency
- **Historical Archiving**: Move completed items to appropriate archive locations
- **Cross-Reference Linking**: Maintain connections between related memory items

## Input/Output Interface

}
```

### Output Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "updated_memory": "updated Memory.md content",
  "actions_taken": [
    {
      "action": "created_issue",
      "issue_number": 123,

```

## Memory Structure Standards

### Required Sections
1. **Active Goals**: Current high-priority objectives
2. **Current Context**: Branch, status, system state
3. **Recent Accomplishments**: Latest completed tasks
4. **Important Context**: Critical decisions and information
5. **Reflections**: Insights and lessons learned

### Optional Sections
- **Next Actions**: Immediate next steps
- **Performance Metrics**: Development velocity and statistics
- **Technical Notes**: Architecture decisions and patterns
- **User Feedback**: Incorporation of user guidance

## GitHub Issues Integration

### Issue Creation Rules
- Create issues for tasks marked as `todo` or `in-progress`
- Apply labels based on task type and priority
- Include relevant context and acceptance criteria
- Link to related PRs, branches, or documentation

### Issue Updates
- Update status when memory tasks change state
- Close issues when tasks are marked as completed
- Update labels when task priority changes
- Add comments for significant progress updates

### Label Management
- `memory-sync`: All memory-synchronized issues
- `ai-assistant`: Tasks managed by AI assistant
- `high-priority`, `medium-priority`, `low-priority`: Priority levels
- `documentation`, `feature`, `bug`, `enhancement`: Task types

## Memory Optimization Strategies

### Pruning Rules
1. **Completed Tasks**: Archive tasks completed > 7 days ago
2. **Outdated Context**: Remove context that's no longer relevant
3. **Consolidated Accomplishments**: Group similar achievements
4. **Duplicate Information**: Remove redundant entries

### Retention Priorities
1. **Active Goals**: Always retain current objectives
2. **Critical Context**: Preserve essential project state
3. **Recent Accomplishments**: Keep last 10-15 major achievements
4. **Important Decisions**: Maintain architectural and design choices
5. **Lessons Learned**: Preserve insights for future reference

## Integration Guidelines

### With Other Agents
- **Orchestrator**: Provide memory context for task coordination
- **Workflow Manager**: Update memory with workflow progress
- **Code Reviewer**: Record review outcomes and learnings
- **Team Coach**: Share performance insights and improvements

### With Development Workflow
- **Branch Creation**: Record new branches in current context
- **PR Lifecycle**: Track PR creation, review, and merge status
- **Issue Management**: Maintain bidirectional sync with GitHub
- **Release Planning**: Update goals based on milestone progress

## Best Practices

### Memory Updates
- Update memory immediately after significant accomplishments
- Include specific details (PR numbers, branch names, metrics)
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Balance detail with readability

### GitHub Synchronization
- Sync at regular intervals (hourly during active development)
- Validate issue titles and descriptions for clarity
- Maintain consistent labeling across all synchronized issues
- Handle rate limiting and API errors gracefully

### Context Management
- Preserve critical architectural decisions
- Archive detailed technical information appropriately
- Maintain links between related concepts and tasks
- Update context when project direction changes

## Error Handling

### Memory File Issues
- Handle corrupted or malformed Memory.md files
- Backup current state before major modifications
- Validate structure after updates
- Recover from parsing errors gracefully

### GitHub API Issues
- Handle rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Retry failed operations with increasing delays
- Log errors for debugging while continuing operation
- Fall back to local-only updates when API unavailable

### Synchronization Conflicts
- Detect and resolve conflicts between Memory.md and Issues
- Prioritize recent changes when conflicts occur
- Preserve user modifications during automated updates
- Provide clear conflict resolution options

## Operations

### Monitor Process
Continuously monitor a running agent process, collecting metrics and status updates.

**Parameters:**
- `process_id`: Unique identifier of the process to monitor
- `monitoring_interval`: Frequency of status checks in seconds
- `collect_metrics`: Whether to collect detailed performance metrics

**Example:**
```json
{
  "operation": "monitor",
  "target": {"process_id": "proc_20250101_120000_abc123"},
  "parameters": {"monitoring_interval": 5, "collect_metrics": true}
}
```

### Start Process Monitoring
Begin monitoring a new agent process with specified configuration.

**Parameters:**
- `agent_type`: Type of agent being monitored
- `task_id`: Associated task identifier
- `resource_limits`: CPU, memory, and timeout limits
- `alert_thresholds`: Thresholds for generating alerts

### Stop Process Monitoring
Stop monitoring a specific process and perform cleanup.

**Parameters:**
- `process_id`: Process to stop monitoring
- `cleanup_resources`: Whether to clean up associated resources

### Get Process Status
Retrieve current status and metrics for monitored processes.

**Parameters:**
- `process_id`: Optional specific process ID, or "all" for all processes
- `include_metrics`: Whether to include detailed metrics
- `include_history`: Whether to include historical data

### Configure Monitoring
Update monitoring configuration for existing or new processes.

**Parameters:**
- `monitoring_config`: Updated configuration settings
- `alert_config`: Updated alert thresholds and channels
- `resource_config`: Updated resource limits

### Generate Alerts
Evaluate current process state against alert thresholds and generate notifications.

**Parameters:**
- `alert_types`: Types of alerts to check ["resource", "performance", "error"]
- `notification_channels`: Where to send alerts
- `severity_filter`: Minimum severity level to report

## Process States

### Process Lifecycle States
- **INITIALIZING**: Process is starting up and initializing
- **RUNNING**: Process is actively executing tasks
- **PAUSED**: Process is temporarily paused (e.g., waiting for resources)
- **COMPLETING**: Process is finishing up and cleaning resources
- **COMPLETED**: Process has finished successfully
- **FAILED**: Process has encountered an error and terminated
- **TERMINATED**: Process was explicitly stopped or killed
- **RECOVERING**: Process is restarting after a failure

### Health States
- **HEALTHY**: All metrics within normal ranges
- **WARNING**: Some metrics approaching thresholds
- **CRITICAL**: Metrics exceeding thresholds, intervention needed
- **UNKNOWN**: Unable to determine health status

# Code Writer Agent

The Code Writer Agent is a specialized component of the Gadugi v0.3 multi-agent system designed to generate, modify, and create source code files based on task descriptions and requirements.

## Purpose

The Code Writer Agent transforms high-level task descriptions into functional, maintainable source code. It serves as the primary execution engine for coding tasks delegated by the orchestrator and task decomposer.

## Key Features

### üîß **Multi-Language Support**
- Python with type hints and PEP 8 compliance
- JavaScript/TypeScript with modern ES6+ patterns
- Support for common frameworks and libraries
- Language-specific best practices and conventions

### üìù **Intelligent Code Generation**
- Analyzes requirements and existing codebase patterns
- Generates complete, functional code implementations
- Includes proper error handling and input validation
- Adds comprehensive documentation and comments

### üéØ **Integration-Focused**
- Works with existing codebases and maintains compatibility
- Follows project-specific patterns and conventions
- Handles dependencies and imports automatically
- Provides integration notes and usage examples

## Usage

The Code Writer Agent integrates seamlessly with the Gadugi v0.3 orchestrator:

### Via Orchestrator
```python
# The orchestrator delegates coding tasks to code-writer
from orchestrator.run_agent import run_agent

result = run_agent("code-writer", "Create user authentication class")
```

### Task Integration
The agent typically receives tasks from the task-decomposer such as:
- "Set up project structure and dependencies"
- "Create data models"
- "Implement API endpoints"
- "Add authentication middleware"

## Code Quality Standards

Every code implementation includes:

### ‚úÖ **Functional Excellence**
- Complete, working implementations
- Proper error handling and edge cases
- Input validation and security considerations
- Performance-optimized logic

### ‚úÖ **Documentation Quality**
- Clear function/class documentation
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Usage examples and integration notes
- Type hints where applicable

### ‚úÖ **Style Consistency**
- Language-specific style guides (PEP 8, etc.)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper code organization and structure
- Modern language patterns and practices

## Supported Patterns

### Backend Development
- REST API endpoints and routing
- Database models and queries
- Authentication and authorization
- Middleware and request processing

### Frontend Development
- Component-based architectures
- Event handling and state management
- API integration and data fetching
- User interface implementation

### Full-Stack Integration
- API client/server communication
- Data validation and serialization
- Configuration management
- Testing setup and implementation

## Output Format

The Code Writer Agent provides structured output:

### üìÅ **File Organization**
```
**File Path**: src/auth/user_auth.py
**Language**: Python
**Dependencies**: hashlib, secrets, typing
```

### üíª **Complete Implementation**
- Full source code with all necessary imports
- Proper class/function definitions
- Error handling and validation
- Documentation strings and comments

### üìã **Integration Information**
- Usage examples and code snippets
- Dependencies and requirements
- Integration notes with existing systems
- Configuration requirements

## Example Workflow

1. **Receive Task**: "Create user authentication system"
2. **Analyze Requirements**: Identify security needs, database integration
3. **Generate Code**: Create complete authentication class with security features
4. **Add Documentation**: Include usage examples and integration notes
5. **Validate Quality**: Ensure code meets all quality standards

## Integration with Other Agents

The Code Writer Agent works closely with:

- **Task Decomposer**: Receives broken-down coding subtasks
- **Prompt Writer**: Can use detailed prompts for complex implementations
- **Test Writer**: Coordinates to ensure testable code structure
- **Orchestrator**: Reports completion and integration status

## Advanced Features

### üîç **Context Analysis**
- Analyzes existing codebase for patterns and conventions
- Maintains consistency with project architecture
- Identifies and resolves potential integration issues

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Integration**
- Implements security best practices by default
- Includes input validation and sanitization
- Follows secure coding guidelines for each language

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization**
- Generates efficient, optimized code
- Considers scalability and resource usage
- Implements appropriate caching and optimization patterns

## Contributing

The Code Writer Agent follows Gadugi v0.3 standards:
- Structured markdown agent definition
- Integration with orchestrator framework
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Documentation with examples and patterns

## Next Steps

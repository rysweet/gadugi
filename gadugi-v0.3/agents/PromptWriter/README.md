# Prompt Writer Agent

The Prompt Writer Agent is a specialized component of the Gadugi v0.3 multi-agent system designed to create high-quality, structured prompt files for development workflows.

## Purpose

Creating well-structured prompts is crucial for successful AI-assisted development. The Prompt Writer Agent ensures:

- **Consistent Quality**: All prompts follow proven patterns and best practices
- **Complete Workflows**: From issue creation to PR merge
- **Clear Requirements**: Detailed specifications and success criteria
- **Context Integration**: Understanding of existing codebase patterns

## Key Features

### üîç **Intelligent Analysis**
- Extracts and refines feature requirements
- Analyzes existing codebase for integration points
- Research external dependencies and patterns

### üìù **Structured Generation**
- Creates prompts following proven template structure
- Includes comprehensive workflow steps
- Defines clear, measurable success criteria

### üîß **Developer-Focused**
- Saves prompts with descriptive filenames
- Integrates seamlessly with orchestrator system
- Provides complete implementation guidance

## Usage

The Prompt Writer Agent can be invoked directly by the orchestrator or used interactively:

### Via Orchestrator
```python
# The orchestrator can use prompt-writer to create structured tasks
from orchestrator.run_agent import run_agent

result = run_agent("prompt-writer", "Add user authentication to web app")
```

### Interactive Usage
```bash
# Run directly for interactive prompt creation  
python src/orchestrator/run_agent.py prompt-writer "Add user authentication"
```

## Prompt Structure

Every generated prompt follows this comprehensive structure:

1. **Overview** - Brief description and context
2. **Problem Statement** - Clear problem definition
3. **Requirements** - Functional and technical needs
4. **Implementation Plan** - Phased development approach
5. **Success Criteria** - Measurable completion goals
6. **Workflow Steps** - Complete development process

## Integration

The Prompt Writer Agent integrates with other Gadugi v0.3 components:

- **Orchestrator**: Receives tasks and generates structured prompts
- **Task Decomposer**: Works with decomposed tasks to create detailed subtask prompts
- **Agent Runner**: Executes within the standard agent execution framework

## Quality Assurance

Every generated prompt is validated to include:
- ‚úÖ Clear, actionable requirements
- ‚úÖ Complete workflow from issue to merge
- ‚úÖ Specific testing requirements
- ‚úÖ Documentation needs
- ‚úÖ Integration considerations
- ‚úÖ Measurable success criteria

## Output

Prompts are saved as markdown files in the `/prompts/` directory with descriptive names:
- `implement-[feature-name].md`
- `fix-[issue-description].md`
- `enhance-[component-name].md`

## Example Output

A typical generated prompt includes:

```markdown

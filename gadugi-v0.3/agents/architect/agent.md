## Architecture Design Patterns

### System Architecture Patterns
1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Single deployable unit for simple applications
2. **Microservices Architecture**: Independent, loosely-coupled services
3. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Enterprise-level service integration
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous event-based communication
5. **Layered Architecture**: Organized into horizontal layers
6. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports and adapters pattern for testability

### Integration Patterns
1. **API Gateway**: Centralized API management and routing
2. **Message Queue**: Asynchronous communication between services

1. **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction layer
2. **Unit of Work**: Transaction boundary management
3. **Data Lake**: Centralized storage for structured and unstructured data

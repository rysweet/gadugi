# Architect Agent

The Architect Agent is a comprehensive system design and architecture planning agent for Gadugi v0.3. It specializes in creating detailed system architectures, component designs, integration plans, and technical specifications for complex software projects.

## Overview

The Architect Agent transforms high-level requirements into comprehensive technical architectures with detailed implementation plans, technology recommendations, and risk assessments. It supports multiple architectural patterns and provides enterprise-grade design capabilities.

## Core Capabilities

### System Architecture Design
- **Pattern-Based Design**: Supports monolithic, microservices, layered, SOA, event-driven, and hexagonal architectures
- **Component Design**: Creates detailed component specifications with clear interfaces and responsibilities
- **Integration Planning**: Designs how components interact and integrate with each other
- **Scalability Design**: Ensures systems can scale with growth and changing requirements

### Technical Documentation
- **Design Documents**: Creates comprehensive technical specifications and design documents
- **API Specifications**: Designs RESTful APIs with detailed endpoint definitions
- **Database Design**: Plans database schemas, relationships, and data access patterns
- **System Diagrams**: Generates architectural diagrams and visual representations

### Solution Architecture
- **Technology Selection**: Recommends appropriate technologies, frameworks, and tools
- **Pattern Application**: Applies established architectural patterns and best practices
- **Security Architecture**: Designs security measures, authentication, and authorization systems
- **Performance Architecture**: Plans for performance requirements and optimization strategies

## Architecture Patterns Supported

### System Architecture Patterns
1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Single deployable unit for simple applications
2. **Microservices Architecture**: Independent, loosely-coupled services
3. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Enterprise-level service integration
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous event-based communication
5. **Layered Architecture**: Organized into horizontal layers
6. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports and adapters pattern for testability

### Integration Patterns
1. **API Gateway**: Centralized API management and routing
2. **Message Queue**: Asynchronous communication between services
3. **Event Streaming**: Real-time data processing and event distribution
4. **Database per Service**: Data ownership and independence
5. **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management
6. **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation

# V0.3 Memory Integration Plan

## What We're Really Trying to Achieve with v0.3

### The Core Vision
**v0.3 is a self-improving development system that learns from experience.**

Not just tools that execute tasks, but a system that:
- **Remembers** what worked and what didn't
- **Learns** patterns and best practices over time
- **Accelerates** development through accumulated knowledge
- **Evolves** to become better at building software

### The Key Insight
Each time an agent completes a task, it should become better at similar tasks. When WorkflowManager creates a PR, it should remember what reviewers typically ask for. When orchestrator decomposes tasks, it should learn optimal parallelization patterns.

## Step-by-Step Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Memory Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Agents can remember across sessions

#### Step 1.1: Create V03Agent Base Class
```python
# .claude/agents/base/v03_agent.py
class V03Agent:
    def __init__(self, agent_id: str, agent_type: str):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.agent_type = agent_type
        self.memory = AgentMemoryInterface(agent_id)
        self.knowledge_loaded = False

    async def initialize(self):
        """Load agent's knowledge base from MD files"""
        await self._load_knowledge_base()
        await self._recall_recent_memories()

    async def _load_knowledge_base(self):
        """Load MD files from agent's knowledge directory"""
        knowledge_dir = f".claude/agents/{self.agent_type}/knowledge"
        if Path(knowledge_dir).exists():
            for md_file in Path(knowledge_dir).glob("*.md"):
                content = md_file.read_text()
                await self.memory.remember_long_term(
                    content,
                    tags=["knowledge_base", md_file.stem]
                )
```

#### Step 1.2: Knowledge Directory Structure
```
.claude/agents/
├── WorkflowManager/
│   ├── agent.md
│   ├── workflow_manager.py
│   └── knowledge/
│       ├── git_best_practices.md
│       ├── pr_review_patterns.md
│       └── workflow_phases.md
├── orchestrator/
│   ├── agent.md
│   ├── orchestrator.py
│   └── knowledge/
│       ├── parallelization_patterns.md
│       ├── task_decomposition.md
│       └── performance_optimization.md
```

#### Step 1.3: Memory Persistence Test
- Create simple test agent
- Store memories
- Restart system
- Verify memories persist
- Confirm knowledge base loads

### Phase 2: First Memory-Enabled Agent (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: WorkflowManager becomes fully memory-enabled

#### Step 2.1: Update WorkflowManager
```python
class WorkflowManagerV03(V03Agent):
    async def execute_workflow(self, prompt_file: str):
        # Remember we've seen this type of task
        similar = await self.memory.recall_similar(prompt_file)
        if similar:
            print(f"Similar to previous task: {similar[0]['content']}")

        # Execute workflow
        for phase in WORKFLOW_PHASES:
            # Remember what we're doing
            await self.memory.remember_short_term(f"Executing {phase}")

            try:
                result = await self.execute_phase(phase)

                # Learn from success
                await self.memory.remember_procedural(
                    f"Success pattern for {phase}",
                    steps=result.steps,
                    context=prompt_file
                )
            except Exception as e:
                # Learn from failure
                await self.memory.remember_long_term(
                    f"Failure in {phase}: {e}",
                    tags=["error", phase]
                )
```

#### Step 2.2: Knowledge Priming for WorkflowManager
Create these knowledge files:
- `pr_review_checklist.md` - Common review points
- `git_workflow.md` - Best practices
- `error_patterns.md` - Common failures and fixes

### Phase 3: Memory-Based Learning (Week 2)
**Goal**: Agents improve performance based on memories

#### Step 3.1: Learning System
```python
class LearningMixin:
    async def learn_from_outcome(self, task, outcome):
        if outcome.success:
            # Store successful pattern
            await self.memory.remember_procedural(
                procedure_name=f"successful_{task.type}",
                steps=outcome.steps,
                context=task.context
            )
            # Increase confidence in this approach
            await self.memory.update_knowledge_confidence(
                task.approach, increase=0.1
            )
        else:
            # Remember what didn't work
            await self.memory.remember_long_term(
                f"Failed approach for {task.type}: {outcome.error}",
                tags=["failure", "learning"]
            )
```

#### Step 3.2: Pattern Recognition
```python
async def find_similar_tasks(self, new_task):
    # Search memories for similar tasks
    similar = await self.memory.search_memories(
        query=new_task.description,
        memory_types=["procedural", "long_term"],
        limit=5
    )

    if similar:
        # Use learned patterns
        best_approach = max(similar, key=lambda x: x.confidence)
        return best_approach.procedure
```

### Phase 4: Agent Collaboration via Memory (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Agents share knowledge and collaborate

#### Step 4.1: Shared Whiteboards
```python
class CollaborativeTask:
    async def setup_collaboration(self, task_id, agents):
        # Create shared whiteboard
        whiteboard = await memory.create_whiteboard(task_id)

        # Each agent contributes
        for agent in agents:
            await agent.contribute_to_whiteboard(whiteboard)
```

#### Step 4.2: Knowledge Transfer
```python
async def share_expertise(self, requesting_agent):
    # Share relevant knowledge
    expertise = await self.memory.get_knowledge_graph()
    relevant = filter_relevant_knowledge(expertise, requesting_agent.current_task)
    await requesting_agent.memory.import_knowledge(relevant)
```

### Phase 5: Orchestrator Memory Integration (Week 3)
**Goal**: Orchestrator uses memory for better task decomposition

#### Step 5.1: Learning Optimal Parallelization
```python
class OrchestratorV03(V03Agent):
    async def decompose_task(self, task):
        # Check if we've done similar decomposition
        similar = await self.memory.recall_similar_decompositions(task)

        if similar:
            # Use previous successful pattern
            decomposition = similar[0]['decomposition']
            # Adjust based on current context
            return self.adapt_decomposition(decomposition, task)
        else:
            # Create new decomposition
            decomposition = await self.create_decomposition(task)
            # Store for future use
            await self.memory.remember_procedural(
                f"decomposition_{task.type}",
                decomposition
            )
```

### Phase 6: Full Integration (Week 4)
**Goal**: All agents memory-enabled and collaborating

#### Step 6.1: Agent Registry with Capabilities
```python
AGENT_REGISTRY = {
    "WorkflowManager": {
        "class": WorkflowManagerV03,
        "expertise": ["git", "pr", "workflow"],
        "knowledge_dir": ".claude/agents/WorkflowManager/knowledge"
    },
    "orchestrator": {
        "class": OrchestratorV03,
        "expertise": ["parallelization", "task_decomposition"],
        "knowledge_dir": ".claude/agents/orchestrator/knowledge"
    }
}
```

## Quick Start Implementation

```bash
# Step 1: Create base structure
mkdir -p .claude/agents/base
mkdir -p .claude/agents/WorkflowManager/knowledge
mkdir -p .claude/agents/orchestrator/knowledge

# Step 2: Create V03Agent base class
cat > .claude/agents/base/v03_agent.py << 'EOF'
[Base class implementation]
EOF

# Step 3: Add knowledge files
echo "# Git Best Practices" > .claude/agents/WorkflowManager/knowledge/git_best_practices.md
echo "# Task Decomposition Patterns" > .claude/agents/orchestrator/knowledge/decomposition.md

# Step 4: Test with first agent
python -c "
from v03_agent import V03Agent
agent = WorkflowManagerV03()
await agent.initialize()  # Loads knowledge
await agent.execute_workflow('test.md')
"
```

## The Transformation

### Before (v0.2)
- Agents are stateless
- Repeat same mistakes
- No learning
- Work in isolation

### After (v0.3)
- Agents remember everything
- Learn from experience
- Share knowledge
- Continuously improve

### Result
**A system that gets better at building software every day.**

Each PR makes the next one easier. Each bug fixed prevents similar bugs. Each successful pattern gets reused. The system compounds its intelligence over time.

This is the real power of v0.3: **Not just tools, but tools that learn.**

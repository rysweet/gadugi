# Team Coach GitHub Integration - Future Work

## Overview
The Team Coach agent currently uses mock GitHub operations for testing and development. Full GitHub integration will be implemented as a future enhancement.

## Current State
- Team Coach implementation is complete with all three phases
- Mock GitHub operations allow testing without API calls
- Core functionality is production-ready

## Future Enhancement: Real GitHub Integration

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
- Replace mock GitHub client with real `gh` CLI integration
- Implement actual PR metadata collection
- Add GitHub API authentication

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Real-time PR monitoring
- Automatic team member capability assessment from commit history
- Integration with GitHub Teams and CODEOWNERS

### Phase 3: Automation
- Automated PR assignment based on team member expertise
- Conflict detection and resolution suggestions
- Performance metrics tracking via GitHub Actions

## Implementation Path
1. Create GitHub client wrapper using `gh` CLI
2. Add configuration for GitHub authentication
3. Implement gradual rollout with feature flags
4. Maintain backward compatibility with mock mode

## Testing Strategy
- Keep mock mode for unit tests
- Add integration tests with test repositories
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout

## Timeline
This enhancement is planned for a future release after the core Team Coach functionality has been validated in production use.

## üìä Concrete Results

### GitHub API Operations Executed:
```bash
# 14 PR retargeting operations
gh pr edit [247,268,269,270,278,279,280,281,282,286,287,293,294,295] --base feature/gadugi-v0.3-regeneration
```

### Verification Commands:
```bash
# Verify all PRs now target correct branch
gh pr list --state open --json number,baseRefName --jq '.[] | select(.number >= 247)'

# Check merge conflict status
gh pr list --state open --json number,mergeable --jq '.[] | select(.mergeable == "CONFLICTING")'
```

## ‚è≥ Next Steps Required

### 1. Resolve Merge Conflicts (Priority 1)
Run the update script to attempt automatic resolution:

For PRs with complex conflicts, manual resolution needed:
```bash
gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER>
git merge origin/feature/gadugi-v0.3-regeneration
# Resolve conflicts manually
git push
```

### 2. Code Reviews (Priority 2)
After conflict resolution, invoke code reviews:
```bash
/agent:code-reviewer
Review PR #<NUMBER> targeting feature/gadugi-v0.3-regeneration
```

### 3. Pyright PR Consolidation (Priority 3)
Analyze overlap between PRs 279, 270, 286, 293:
- Determine most comprehensive fix

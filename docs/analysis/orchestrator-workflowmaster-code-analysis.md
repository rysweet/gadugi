## Conclusion

The analysis reveals a **well-architected system** with **clear specialization** and **manageable duplication**. The 29% code overlap is primarily in utility functions rather than core logic, making extraction feasible without compromising the distinct value propositions of each agent.

**Key Insight**: The current architecture is fundamentally sound. The bottleneck resolved in PR #10 was implementation-specific, not architectural. The **Enhanced Separation** approach preserves all benefits while addressing the identified duplication through shared utilities.

This creates a **strong foundation** for future agent development while maintaining the proven **3-5x performance improvement** that makes the OrchestratorAgent valuable for parallel execution scenarios.

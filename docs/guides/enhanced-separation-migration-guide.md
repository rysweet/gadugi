## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Shared Module Deployment (2-3 days)

#### Step 1.1: Deploy Shared Modules
```bash
# Ensure you're on the correct branch
git checkout feature/orchestrator-workflowmaster-analysis-15

# Verify shared modules are present
ls -la .claude/shared/
# Should contain:
# - github_operations.py (30 tests)
# - state_management.py (37 tests)  
# - error_handling.py (59 tests)
# - task_tracking.py (62 tests)
# - interfaces.py (33 tests)
```

#### Step 1.2: Run Shared Module Tests
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
python -m pytest tests/shared/ -v

# Expected output: 221 passed tests
# This validates all shared modules are functional
```

#### Step 1.3: Verify Module Integration
```bash
# Test module imports
python -c "
from .claude.shared.github_operations import GitHubOperations
from .claude.shared.state_management import StateManager
from .claude.shared.utils.error_handling import ErrorHandler
from .claude.shared.task_tracking import TaskTracker
print('âœ… All shared modules imported successfully')
"
```

### Phase 2: Agent Migration (1-2 weeks)

#### Step 2.1: Update OrchestratorAgent

The OrchestratorAgent has been updated with Enhanced Separation integration:

**Key Changes:**
- Added shared module imports in agent frontmatter
- Enhanced orchestration workflow with error handling
- Advanced performance analytics and metrics
- Comprehensive state management with checkpoints
- Circuit breaker protection for resilient operations

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check updated agent file
cat .claude/agents/orchestrator-agent.md | head -20
# Should show imports section with shared modules

# Verify agent can be invoked (test with simple prompt)
claude /agent:orchestrator-agent "Test basic functionality"
```

#### Step 2.2: Update WorkflowManager  

The WorkflowManager has been updated with Enhanced Separation integration:

**Key Changes:**
- Added shared module imports in agent frontmatter
- Enhanced workflow phases with comprehensive error handling
- Advanced task tracking with dependency validation
- Robust state management and recovery systems
- TodoWrite integration with validation

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check updated agent file  
cat .claude/agents/workflow-master.md | head -20
# Should show imports section with shared modules

# Verify agent can be invoked (test with simple prompt)
claude /agent:workflow-manager "Test basic functionality"
```

#### Step 2.3: Update Agent Documentation

Both agents now include comprehensive documentation of shared module usage:

- **Shared Module Initialization**: How to initialize and configure shared components
- **Enhanced Workflow Patterns**: New workflow patterns using shared modules
- **Error Handling Integration**: Advanced error handling and recovery
- **Performance Benefits**: Documentation of optimization gains

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation (2-4 weeks)

#### Step 3.1: Integration Testing
```bash
# Run integration tests (if available)
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Run end-to-end workflow tests
# This validates agents work correctly with shared modules
```

#### Step 3.2: Performance Validation
```bash
# Validate performance improvements
python -m pytest tests/shared/ -k "performance" -v

# Expected results:
# - Operations complete within performance thresholds
# - Memory usage optimized
# - No regression in execution speed
```

#### Step 3.3: Functional Testing

Test key workflows to ensure functionality is preserved:

**OrchestratorAgent Testing:**
```bash
# Test parallel execution
claude /agent:orchestrator-agent "
Execute these prompts in parallel:
- test-feature-a.md  
- test-feature-b.md
- test-feature-c.md
"

# Should demonstrate:
# - Task analysis with shared modules
# - Environment setup with state management
# - Parallel execution with error handling
# - Result integration with performance analytics
```

**WorkflowManager Testing:**
```bash
# Test complete workflow execution
claude /agent:workflow-manager "
Task: Execute workflow for test-implementation.md
"

# Should demonstrate:
# - Enhanced task initialization with resumption
# - Robust issue creation with retry logic
# - Advanced state management with checkpoints
# - Comprehensive task tracking with validation
```

### Phase 4: Production Deployment

#### Step 4.1: Gradual Rollout
1. **Test Environment**: Deploy and validate in test environment
2. **Staging Environment**: Run with real workflows in staging
3. **Limited Production**: Deploy to subset of production workflows
4. **Full Production**: Complete rollout after validation

#### Step 4.2: Monitoring Setup
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor execution times and resource usage
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor error rates and recovery success
- **Usage Analytics**: Track agent invocation patterns and success rates

#### Step 4.3: Rollback Plan
- **State Backup**: Automated backup of workflow states
- **Agent Versioning**: Ability to revert to previous agent versions  
- **Quick Recovery**: Documented procedures for rapid rollback

# Solution: Verify Python path and module structure
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/.claude/shared"
python -c "from github_operations import GitHubOperations; print('OK')"
```

#### Issue: Agent Invocation Failures
```bash
# Symptoms: Agent fails to start or responds with errors
# Solution: Check agent file syntax and imports
claude --validate-agent orchestrator-agent
claude --validate-agent workflow-master
```

#### Issue: Performance Regression
```bash
# Symptoms: Slower execution than expected
# Solution: Run performance diagnostics
python -m pytest tests/shared/ -k "performance" -v --tb=short
```

#### Issue: State Management Errors
```bash
# Symptoms: Workflow state not persisting or corrupting
# Solution: Check state directory and permissions
ls -la .github/workflow-states/
# Verify write permissions and disk space
```

### Recovery Procedures

#### Agent Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous agent version
git checkout HEAD~1 -- .claude/agents/orchestrator-agent.md
git checkout HEAD~1 -- .claude/agents/workflow-master.md
git commit -m "Rollback agents to previous version"
```

#### Shared Module Rollback
```bash
# Remove shared modules (fallback to embedded code)
git rm -r .claude/shared/
git commit -m "Remove shared modules for rollback"
```

#### Complete System Rollback
```bash
# Revert entire Enhanced Separation implementation
git revert <migration-commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

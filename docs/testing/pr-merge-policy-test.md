# PR Merge Policy Test Scenarios

## Test Scenario 1: Successful Review Response with User Approval

### Setup
- PR #123 with review feedback
- All feedback addressed
- CI/CD passing

### Expected Agent Behavior

1. **Agent completes Phase 10 (Review Response)**:
   ```
   I've completed addressing all review feedback:
   - ✅ 2 critical issues fixed
   - ✅ 3 improvements implemented
   - ✅ 1 question answered
   - ✅ All tests passing
   - ✅ Documentation updated

   PR #123 status:
   - ✅ All review comments addressed
   - ✅ CI/CD checks passing
   - ✅ No merge conflicts
   - ✅ Ready for final review

   The PR is ready for merge. Would you like me to:
   - Merge it now?
   - Wait for additional review?
   - Make any other changes first?

   Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
   ```

2. **User Response**: "Yes, please merge it"

3. **Agent Action**:
   ```bash
   gh pr merge 123 --merge --delete-branch
   ```

## Test Scenario 2: Review Response with User Deferral

### Expected Agent Behavior

1. **Agent completes review response and asks for approval**
2. **User Response**: "Not yet, let's wait for John to review"
3. **Agent Action**:
   ```
   Understood. I'll wait for John's review before proceeding with the merge.
   The PR remains open and ready for additional review.
   ```

## Test Scenario 3: No User Response (Timeout Test)

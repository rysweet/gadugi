# Parallel Test Task 1 Documentation

## Overview

This is a test task designed to validate the parallel execution capabilities of the OrchestratorAgent system. The task writes timestamps to files with a controlled delay to allow timing analysis.

## Purpose

- Validate parallel task execution
- Test worktree isolation
- Verify file system operations in parallel environments
- Measure task timing and completion

## Implementation

The task is implemented as a Python script: `scripts/parallel_test_task_1.py`

### Functionality

1. **Initial Timestamp**: Writes the exact execution time to `/tmp/parallel-task-1.txt`
2. **Processing Delay**: Waits for 3 seconds to simulate processing time
3. **Completion Timestamp**: Writes the completion time to `/tmp/parallel-task-1-done.txt`

### Output Files

- `/tmp/parallel-task-1.txt` - Contains the task start timestamp
- `/tmp/parallel-task-1-done.txt` - Contains the task completion timestamp

## Usage

```bash
# Execute the script directly
python3 scripts/parallel_test_task_1.py

# Or make it executable
chmod +x scripts/parallel_test_task_1.py
./scripts/parallel_test_task_1.py
```

## Verification

To verify successful execution:

```bash
# Check if files were created
ls -la /tmp/parallel-task-*.txt

# View timestamps
cat /tmp/parallel-task-1.txt
cat /tmp/parallel-task-1-done.txt
```

## Integration with OrchestratorAgent

This task is designed to be executed by the OrchestratorAgent as part of parallel execution testing. When run alongside other parallel test tasks, it helps validate:

- Concurrent execution
- Resource isolation
- Timing accuracy
- File system access patterns

## Related Tasks

- Parallel Test Task 2 (similar structure, different output files)
- Other orchestrator test scenarios

## Troubleshooting

If the script fails:

1. Check write permissions for `/tmp` directory
2. Verify Python 3 is installed and accessible
3. Ensure the Path module is available (standard library)
4. Check for existing files that might cause conflicts

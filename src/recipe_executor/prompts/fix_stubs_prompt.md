## Your Task
1. Read the existing files in {output_path}
2. Find ALL stubs, TODOs, and placeholder implementations
3. Replace them with REAL, WORKING implementations
4. Ensure every function does actual work, not just returns dummy values

## CRITICAL Instructions
- NO STUBS: Replace all "pass", "raise NotImplementedError", "TODO" with real code
- NO PLACEHOLDERS: Every function must do real work

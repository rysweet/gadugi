# Generate Tests for {recipe_name}

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

You are following TDD methodology. Generate comprehensive tests FIRST that will initially FAIL.
These tests will drive the implementation.

## Requirements to Test

{requirements}

## Success Criteria
{success_criteria}

## Test Guidelines

1. Create pytest-compatible test files
2. Test ALL MUST requirements with specific test cases
3. Include unit tests for each component
4. Include integration tests for component interactions
5. Use fixtures and parameterized tests where appropriate
6. Tests should be comprehensive enough to drive implementation
7. Include edge cases and error conditions

Generate test files that will fail initially (since no implementation exists yet).
